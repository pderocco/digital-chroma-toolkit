<p><em>arpeggiation:</em> The generation of sequences of notes based on a chord
played by the user, which are then played by a single <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_voice')">voice</span>. Several of the
keyboard algorithms perform arpeggiation.</p>
<p>Note that keyboard algorithms are performed by the <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_preprocessor')">preprocessor</span>, so the
resulting arpeggiated notes are what is sent to the MIDI record output, not the
original chord.</p>
