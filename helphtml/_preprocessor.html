<p><em>preprocessor:</em> The software module in the Digital Chroma that splits
the notes from the keyboard into main and <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_link_program')">link</span> streams, does main
and link octave transpositions, performs keyboard algorithms like
<span class="popup" onclick="popup('_arpeggiation')">arpeggiation</span>, and handles the <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_footswitch')">footswitch</span> and <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_ribbon')">ribbon</span> mode
<span class="popup" onclick="popup('_parameter')">parameters</span>.</p>
<p>When recording a sequence in an external DAW via the <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_USB_device_port')">USB device port</span>
MIDI, it is the output of the preprocessor that is recorded. This means that
the USB device port MIDI input doesn&rsquo;t perform those preprocessor
functions, or support those parameters, since those functions were already
performed during the recording.</p>
