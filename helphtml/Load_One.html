<h1>Load One</h1>
<p>Pressing LOAD ONE normally loads the currently selected <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_program')">program</span> bank from
  the external drive into the Chroma. First, it prompts the user with a display
  like the following:</p>
<p><img src="load-one-prompt.png"></p>
<p>&ldquo;new 13&rdquo; means that 13 of the programs on the external drive
  don&rsquo;t exist in the Chroma.</p>
<p>&ldquo;chg 11&rdquo; means that 11 of the programs on the external drive
  also exist in the Chroma, but they are changed, as indicated by their having
  different timestamps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;del 3&rdquo; means that 3 of the programs in the Chroma don&rsquo;t
  exist on the external drive, and will therefore be deleted.</p>
<p>If there are programs on the external drive that match those in the Chroma,
  they aren&rsquo;t shown or copied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Store=Y, Set Split=N&rdquo; tells you to press the STORE switch if
  you wish to copy the bank, or press SET SPLIT if you want to skip it. Both
  LEDs flash, as a reminder that you can press either switch. While copying,
  the display flashes a message saying what bank it is copying. When done, the
  display shows the results with a display like the following:</p>
<p><img src="load-one-result.png"></p>
<p>If there are any errors accessing the device, it will also show the number
  of operations that failed. The display reverts to the current parameter
  whenever the parameter slider is moved, or most any other panel operation is
  performed.</p>
<p>Holding PROG SELECT and pressing 1 to 9 temporarily selects a different bank
  (and puts 100 to 900 in the program number display). Pressing LOAD ONE then
  loads from and to that bank instead of the currently selected bank.</p>
<p>Holding LOAD ONE and pressing 1 to 9 changes what bank on the external drive
  will be loaded, allowing programs to be moved from one bank to another. You
  can do this even after holding PROG SELECT and pressing 1 to 9 to select a
  different internal bank, for complete flexibility. For instance, holding
  PROG SELECT and pressing 3, then holding LOAD ONE and pressing 5, will load
  external bank 5 into bank 3.</p>
<p>So remember, PROG SELECT plus a number sets both the internal and external
  bank, LOAD ONE plus a number sets only the external bank.</p>
