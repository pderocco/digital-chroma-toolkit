<h1>Connection button</h1>
<p><img src="connection-button.png" width=192></p>
<p>This button shows what MIDI port the Toolkit is currently connected to,
  and allows you to select a different port.</p>
<p>Normally, you want to connect the Digital Chroma to your computer via its
  <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_USB_device_port')">USB device port</span>, which has four virtual jacks that can be used not only
  for the Toolkit but for recording and playback via a DAW. The names of the
  ports depend upon the computer&rsquo;s operating system and the specific
  driver.</p>
<p>Tapping this button drops down a list of available ports. If you have a
  Chroma connected to a Windows machine, you may see the following:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 16px"><img src="ports-popup.png" width=175></p>
<p>You can tap any of the available choices, and as long as no other program
  already has that port open, the Toolkit will connect to it, and spend a
  second or so downloading information from the Chroma.</p>
<p class="extra">This clumsy naming is the behavior of the Windows MIDI
  driver, but the first four choices correspond to what the Digital Chroma
  calls DevA, DevB, DevC, and DevD. You can choose any of the four virtual
  jacks, but if you are also recording and playing MIDI with a DAW, you must
  choose one that the DAW isn&rsquo;t using.</p>
<h2>Connection states</h2>
<p>The button shows the current connection state above the port name, which
  can be:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="2%"/>
    <td width="20%">Looking for</td>
    <td>The selected port doesn&rsquo;t exist</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td>Waiting for</td>
    <td>The selected port is in use by another program</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td>Connecting to</td>
    <td>The port has been opened but the Digital Chroma hasn&rsquo;t
      responded yet</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td>Connected to</td>
    <td>The Digital Chroma is connected</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>How can a port be selected if it doesn&rsquo;t exist? On startup, the
  Toolkit tries to connect to whatever it was last connected to. If the
  Digital Chroma has been disconnected or is turned off, then the Toolkit
  will remain in the &ldquo;Looking for&rdquo; state until the Digital
  Chroma is plugged in and turned on.</p>
<h2>Demonstrator mode</h2>
<p>The drop down list always ends with the &ldquo;Demonstrator&rdquo; choice.
  Selecting this &ldquo;connects&rdquo; to an internal emulator which
  imitates the communication functions of the instrument, although
  doesn&rsquo;t generate any sound. This lets you explore the editor and
  learn its functions, even if you don&rsquo;t have a Digital Chroma
  connected.</p>
<p class="extra">Any changes you make to the set of programs in the
  emulator don&rsquo;t persist if you close the Toolkit and reopen it
  again, so you can mess around to your heart&rsquo;s content without
  worrying about losing anything.</p>
