<h1>Toolkit controls</h1>
<p>The Toolkit uses a few simple types of <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_control')">controls</span>, which can be
  activated by touch or with a mouse.</p>
<table class="vt">
  <tr>
    <td width="2%"/>
    <td width="15%"><i>button</i></td>
    <td>This is a small rectangular area with rounded corners, which contains
      either a fixed label or a variable value, and that does something when
      tapped. It may respond to other <span class="page" onclick="page('Toolkit_gestures')">gestures</span> as well.
      <p class="extra">Note that fixed labels are always shown in italics, and
        variable values are shown in upright type.</p></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td><i>slider</i></td>
    <td>This is a wider rectangular area, with a value in the center and a
      colored bar whose length reflects the value, and which smoothly changes
      when dragged horizontally. It may respond to other gestures as well.<br>
      Sliders have two &ldquo;speeds&rdquo;. When you start to drag, or change
      direction, they change slowly, so that you can adjust them accurately.
      After a short distance, they change more rapidly, so that you can cover
      the entire range without running off the edge of the screen. It
      doesn&rsquo;t matter where you initially touch the slider.
      <p class="extra">If a value is unipolar (has no negative values), the bar
        always starts at the left. If it is bipolar, it starts in the middle
        and grows left or right depending on the polarity.</p></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td><i>popup title</i></td>
    <td>Secondary information and functions are often contained in popups,
      which are displayed when a button on the main screen is tapped or
      long-pressed. The title at the top of a popup acts as a
      &ldquo;control&rdquo; because tapping it dismisses the popup. (Tapping
      the dimmed area around the popup also dismisses it.)</br>
      In the <em>Editor</em>, <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_parameter')">parameter</span> <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_cluster')">cluster</span> popups can be dragged
      around by their titles. When you do this, the main screen is no longer
      dimmed, and you can manipulate its controls, or even display additional
      cluster popups. You can still dismiss the popups by tapping their titles.
      </td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td><i>section title</i></td>
    <td>Certain sections of the screen have titles that actually do something
      when you tap them. In the <em>Editor</em>, tapping on one of the
      <i>Glide</i>, <i>Sweep</i>, or <i>Envelope</i> section titles highlights
      the buttons of the clusters that are modulated by these control
      sources.</td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td><i>text entry</i></td>
    <td>Certain popups display text and allow it to be edited. Clicking or
      tapping in the text display changes its background color from pale yellow
      to pale blue, and selects all the text in darker blue. Typing replaces
      the current contents, but tapping deselects the text and positions the
      cursor for inserting or appending text. Standard line editing keys are
      supported. Escape abandons the changes, and returns the display to its
      original state. If it is a single-line field, Enter accepts the changes;
      if it is a multi-line field, you have to press Enter twice at the end in
      order to accept the changes. (If you press it twice in the middle of the
      text, you insert a blank line.) Note that due to limitations in the
      Digital Chroma, only ASCII characters are allowed.</td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td><i>link</i></td>
    <td>The Help system obviously uses links, the way a web browser does.
      Long-pressing a blue link opens it in a new tab. Green links, however,
      pop up a definition of a term, which can be dismissed by tapping the
      popup or the page behind it.</td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td><i>tab</i></td>
    <td>These are buttons just above the help screen text. The Help system uses
      tabs the way a web browser does. Long-pressing a tab closes it. If there
      are too many tabs to fit in the screen width, you can see the rest by
      dragging left or right.</td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td><i>page</i></td>
    <td>The Help system displays pages of text, but they can also be dragged
      vertically if they are longer than the screen height. You can also use a
      mouse wheel, the Page Up, Page Down, Home, and End keys, or long-press in
      the bottom or top half to jump to the end or back to the
      beginning.</td></tr>
