<h1>Old Chroma import</h1>
<p>The old Chroma provided a crude way to save programs on an audio cassette.
  Somewhat later, the Syntech Chroma to MIDI Converter provided a cleaner way
  to convert programs into a MIDI <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_Sysex')">Sysex</span> packet, which could be stored in a
  computer file. This has become a de facto standard for Chroma program 
  storage. This import tool converts the cassette format into the Syntech Sysex 
  format, after which the <span class="page" onclick="page('Old_Chroma_convert')">Old Chroma convert</span> tool can convert the programs 
  into the Digital Chroma&rsquo;s format. It can accept input from two 
  sources, depending upon whether the &ldquo;from device&rdquo; or &ldquo;from file&rdquo; button is
  selected.</p>

<h2>Importing from audio device</h2>
<p><img src="old-chroma-import-device.png" width=346></p>
<p>Before upgrading your Chroma to a Digital Chroma, you can import the
  programs it contains by connecting the cassette interface output to the audio
  input on the computer running the Toolkit. To speed up the process, you
  should turn on the LOCK switch on the back of the Chroma, so that the
  programs will be transmitted without two-second gaps between them.</p>
<p>If you have sets of programs already stored on cassettes, you can connect
  the output of your cassette player to the computer&rsquo;s audio input
  instead.</p>
<p>If you need to choose something other than the default audio input on the
  computer, tap the <i>input device</i> button, and tap the appropriate choice
  from the popup list.</p>
<p>Next, tap the <i>output file</i> button, use the dialog box to navigate to
  the folder where you wish to store the Sysex file, enter a file name, and OK
  the dialog. A .syx extension will be added if you don&rsquo;t specify one.</p>
<p>Finally, tap the &ldquo;import&rdquo; button. A progress bar containing &ldquo;0 / 0&rdquo; will
  appear. This means it has decoded zero out of zero programs received. Press
  SAVE ALL on the Chroma, or PLAY on the cassette, and you should soon see the
  progress bar counting the 50 programs. The progress bar also fills in with a
  pale green color, although any failed program causes a sliver of the bar to
  turn pink instead.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t see this activity, you may need to adjust the volume of your
  cassette, or the input level on your computer. Computers generally provide a
  way to listen to what&rsquo;s coming into the line input, to hear if everything&rsquo;s
  hooked up correctly. You can abort the operation by tapping the button,
  which now says &ldquo;cancel&rdquo;, and then tap it again to start the import over.</p>
<p>If it doesn&rsquo;t receive 50 programs, it will stop with the progress bar part
  way across. If it says &ldquo;49 / 49&rdquo; it means it received 49 programs
  successfully, and the bar will be mostly green. If it says &ldquo;40 / 44&rdquo; it means
  it received 44 programs, but only 40 of them were properly decoded, and there
  will be some pink slivers showing the bad ones. In any case, you can tap
  &ldquo;cancel&rdquo; to abort the operation, and try again with different settings.</p>
<p>If 50 programs are successfully converted, the operation stops
  automatically, the progress bar disappears, and the button reverts to
  &ldquo;import&rdquo;. If 50 programs are received but some of them have errors, the
  progress bar shows a list of the failed programs, and the buttons changes to
  &ldquo;dismiss&rdquo;. You can click the button to dismiss the progress bar, which
  changes the button back to &ldquo;import&rdquo;, after which you can try again. It also
  copies the list of failed programs (or any other error message) to the
  clipboard.</p>

<h2>Importing from a file</h2>
<p><img src="old-chroma-import-file.png" width=346></p>
<p>If you have previously used your computer to capture the SAVE ALL output of
  your Chroma in uncompressed .wav files, or if you&rsquo;ve received such files from
  someone else, you can import directly from those files. The tool supports any
  sample rate from 8KHz to 64KHz, mono or stereo, 8-bit or 16-bit samples. To
  import from a file, you tap the <i>input file</i> button to select the input
  file, then tap the <i>output file</i> button to select the output file, and
  finally tap the &ldquo;import&rdquo; button. The progress bar should zip across in a
  fraction of a second. Errors are handled the same is in the audio input
  mode.</p>
