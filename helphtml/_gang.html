<p><em>gang:</em> In the Toolkit, to tie two <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_cluster')">clusters</span> together so
that one set of controls operates both in parallel. The only clusters that can
be ganged are those A and B clusters that are adjacent to each other. They are
ganged by <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_drag')">dragging</span> one cluster button onto its twin, which copies its
parameters. The B channel cluster controls are replaced with a large button
with an equals sign, which can be <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_tap')">tapped</span> to ungang the clusters.</p>
