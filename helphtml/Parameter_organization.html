<h1>Parameter organization</h1>
<p>Obviously, it takes a lot of <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_parameter')">parameters</span> to describe a complete
  sound. The Chroma has fifty dual-purpose switches on its control panel which
  are used for selecting sound <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_program')">programs</span> during performance, but in a
  different panel mode are used for selecting the individual parameters of the
  sound, showing them in the display, and connecting the single
  <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_parameter_control')">parameter control</span> slider to them. The PROG SELECT and PARAM SELECT
  switches choose between these two basic modes.</p>
<p>Even the original Chroma had more than 50 parameters, though. However, most
  of them were mirrored between the two <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_channel')">channels</span> that make up the
  <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_voice')">voice</span>, so they shared the same set of switches. The EDIT A and EDIT B
  switches set the Edit Mode, which determines which channel is being edited at
  any time. They can be turned on concurrently by pressing both at the same
  time, in which case the display shows both parameter values, and the
  parameter slider modifies both channels&rsquo; parameters in parallel.
  Parameters 6 through 50 are &ldquo;channel parameters&rdquo; which are
  steered by the Edit Mode; parameters 1 through 5 are &ldquo;control
  parameters&rdquo; which affect the entire voice.</p>
<p>The Digital Chroma has considerably more parameters. To get at these
  &ldquo;extended parameters&rdquo;, you use the SET SPLIT switch. The main
  function of this switch is to establish a keyboard split point, but it is
  also used as a prefix switch for accessing secondary functions. When the
  panel is in Parameter Select mode, pressing SET SPLIT followed by a number
  selects an <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_extended_parameter')">extended parameter</span>, instead of a regular parameter. Most
  extended parameters are related in some way to the corresponding regular
  parameter, providing additional adjustability that wasn&rsquo;t available in
  the original Chroma.</p>
<p>There are also a handful of &ldquo;panel parameters&rdquo;. These are
  parameters that have their own special controls. For instance, the Edit Mode
  is a panel parameter, as is the number of the regular or extended parameter
  currently connected to the slider. This means that when you create a new
  sound and store it, you should choose some parameter that you might wish to
  vary in performance, and make sure that&rsquo;s selected before storing the
  sound, because that parameter will automatically be selected whenever you
  recall that sound.</p>
<p>The tone controls are also panel parameters, rather than global tone
  controls on the output. (If you want to equalize for your speakers, use your
  mixer&rsquo;s or amplifier&rsquo;s controls.) They can be varied during
  performance, but their settings are stored when a sound is stored, thus
  making them useful for &ldquo;voicing&rdquo; a sound.</p>
