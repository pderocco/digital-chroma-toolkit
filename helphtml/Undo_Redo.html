<h1>Undo/Redo</h1>
<p>In any programmable instrument, it is easy to lose important information if
  you press the wrong button. You&rsquo;ve created a new sound, and you store
  it under the wrong number, losing another <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_program')">program</span>. In the Digital Chroma
  (as in the original Chroma), it is also easy to lose a bunch of edits
  you&rsquo;ve made to a program but haven&rsquo;t saved yet by selecting a new
  program, because you tried to select a <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_parameter')">parameter</span> but didn&rsquo;t notice
  that you had put the panel back into PROG SELECT mode.</p>
<p>The solution to this is Undo. Since the Digital Chroma never goes out of
  tune, the AUTO TUNE switch has been appropriated for this purpose. Any time
  you do the wrong thing from the control panel, just press AUTO TUNE and it
  undoes the last thing you did, and briefly shows what it undid in the
  display. Press it repeatedly and step backward through time as far as you
  want. The undo buffer is usually large enough to hold everything you changed
  since you turned the instrument on.</p>
<p>Here are the things that you can undo:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Selecting a program from the panel, or via the Sequence Program
    footswitch. This includes special functions like selecting a program
    except for its <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_link_program')">link</span> parameters. When you undo a program
    selection, you get back exactly what the current program was before,
    including any edits you hadn&rsquo;t saved.</li>
  <li>Editing the current program. Edits that occur within a few seconds of
    each other are combined into single undoable events.</li>
  <li>Storing a program from the panel. When you undo this, it restores the
    previous program that was stored under that number, and restores the
    current program&rsquo;s previous number. If you had made any edits to the
    current program, you will now have to store them somewhere else if you want
    to keep them.</li>
  <li>Exchanging the current program with a stored program, via the SET SPLIT,
    STORE function. Undo exchanges them again.</li>
  <li>Loading all programs, or individual banks of programs, from an external
    flash drive, using LOAD ALL or LOAD ONE. All changes are undone in a
    single Undo. Note that saving programs to an external flash drive is not
    undoable.</li>
  <li>Modifying stored programs via the network. All changes detected within a
    second or so of each other are combined into a single undoable event.</li>
  <li>Restoring all programs, or individual banks of programs, via the
    Toolkit&rsquo;s <span class="page" onclick="page('Backup_restore')">Backup &amp; restore</span> tool, or converting a bank of programs using the
    <span class="page" onclick="page('Old_Chroma_convert')">Old Chroma convert</span> tool. All changes are undone in a single Undo. Note
    that backing up programs is not undoable, because the backups are external
    to the Digital Chroma.</li>
  </ul>
<p>If you go back in time by many steps, it&rsquo;s also easy to go too far. If
  you do that, the solution is Redo, which is invoked with SET SPLIT, AUTO
  TUNE. This redoes the last thing you undid, and briefly shows what it redid
  in the display. You can repeat this operation until you&rsquo;ve gone all the
  way back to the &ldquo;present&rdquo;, and there is nothing more to redo. But
  be aware that as soon as you perform any of the functions listed above, the
  redo buffer is discarded, and you can only undo.</p>
<p>The Undo/Redo mechanism records all changes regardless of whether they come
  from the Digital Chroma panel or the Toolkit. Undo and Redo can also be
  invoked by the Toolkit.</li>
