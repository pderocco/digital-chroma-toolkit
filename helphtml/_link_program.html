<p><em>Link:</em> In a Digital Chroma <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_program')">program</span>, a set of
<span class="popup" onclick="popup('_parameter')">parameters</span> that refer to a second program that is played in
parallel with the main program. Selecting a program creates an <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_instrument')">instrument</span>
to play the main program, and if the Link Mode parameter isn&rsquo;t set to No
Link, creates a second instrument to play the link program. They can be
layered, or the keyboard can be split, or one can be played by an external
keyboard or pedalboard via MIDI.</p>
