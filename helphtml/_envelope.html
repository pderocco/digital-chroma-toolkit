<p><em>envelope:</em> A <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_control_signal')">control signal</span> generator that generates a signal
that is usually triggered at the start of a note, rises to a peak value that
may vary with <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_velocity')">velocity</span> or other things, then optionally decay toward zero,
and finally decay toward zero when the note is released. Each <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_voice')">voice</span> has two
basic envelopes, plus two more that can also be delayed or repetitively
triggered by <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_sweep')">sweep</span> generators or other things. These latter two can also be
computed by the virtual <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_instrument')">instrument</span>, for envelopes that are common to all
<span class="popup" onclick="popup('_voice')">voices</span>, for effects like simulating Hammond organ percussion.</p>
<p><i>Also:</i> <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_glide')">glide</span>, <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_sweep')">sweep</span></p>
