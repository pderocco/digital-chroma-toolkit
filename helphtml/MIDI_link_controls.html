<h1>MIDI link controls</h1>
<p>The Link Balance, Spread and Detune controls use non-standard high-numbered
  MIDI controls to introduce differences between the main and
  <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_link_program')">link</span> sounds, without having to modify the <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_program')">programs</span>
  controlling those sounds. The <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_preprocessor')">preprocessor</span> automatically injects these,
  with complementary values, into the main and link channels whenever a link is
  set up, or sets them to mid-scale when a link is turned off. These controls
  are lo-res, are always monophonic, and set values that are sampled once by
  each voice at the start of a note, so that when a link is turned on or off,
  the sounds of currently held notes don&rsquo;t suddenly change. It also
  means that when they&rsquo;re edited, a note must be restruck in order to
  hear the changes.<p>
<p>The Link Balance control is a linear volume control. As the Link Balance
  parameter is varied from &ndash;15 to 15, it chooses values that make the
  main and link differ by &ndash;15db to 15db, in 1db steps, while retaining a
  constant power sum. At mid-scale, both channels are set to 90, and at either
  extreme one is set to 22 and the other to 125.</p>
<p>The Link Spread squeezes the panning range of the sound toward one side or
  the other. When set to 64 midscale, the sound can pan itself from full left
  to full right; when set to 32 or 96, panning is constrained to the left or
  right half of the range; and when set to zero or 127, the sound is forced all
  the way to the left or right. Since the Link Spread parameter normally
  injects these into the main and link players with opposite values, the two
  sounds are spread to opposite sides.</p>
<p>The Link Detune detunes the sound slightly, and is scaled in half cents at
  middle C, with the beat frequency doubling with every two octaves
  (half-scale detuning). Since the Link Detune parameter normally injects these
  into the main and link players with opposite values, the effective scaling is
  in cents at middle C, just like the Tune Shift parameter, or the Detune
  parameter with Detune Scale set to half scale.</p>
