<h1>Filter controls</h1>
<p>The <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_filter')">filter</span> in the original Chroma was a two-pole lowpass or highpass
  filter; four-pole effects could only be attained by cascading the two
  channels&rsquo; filters. The Digital Chroma allows each filter to be switched
  between two-pole and four-pole, meaning that you can get an eight-pole
  response if both are cascaded in series. (The number of poles basically
  determines how much the out-of-band harmonics are attenuated.) The Digital
  Chroma&rsquo;s filters also have a bandpass setting.</p>
<p>The big limitation of the original Chroma&rsquo;s filters was that they only had
  eight resonance settings, one of which was self-oscillation. The filters
  were also pretty badly tuned, if used as an oscillator, and wouldn&rsquo;t
  self-oscillate above a few kilohertz.</p>
<p>The Digital Chroma solves all that. First of all, the resonance is
  continuously variable, and has <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_extended_parameter')">extended parameters</span> that
  allow it to be modulated by the usual mod sources. The highest three
  resonance settings produce self-oscillation with three different degrees of
  overdrive, yielding different sounds when an oscillator signal is fed through
  the self-oscillating filter.</p>
<p>Also, when set to the highest setting that doesn&rsquo;t self oscillate, the
  resonance of the filter is much higher than the original Chroma. This means
  that the impulse wave shape can be used to generate distinct pitched
  percussive sounds.</p>
<p>Resonance can be usefully modulated by an envelope. One nice effect is to
  produce a short burst of resonance at the start of a note. Another is to do
  the opposite, and produce a sound in which the resonance fades in over
  time. <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_sweep')">Sweep</span> modulation can add resonance on part of each vibrato
  cycle.</p>
<p>To make the filter track the keyboard exactly, you must select one of the
  <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_glide')">glide</span> generators as a modulation source, and set the corresponding depth
  to 32. To make sounds that get somewhat brighter as the pitch goes up, but
  not unnaturally so, the depth should be set to something less, perhaps around
  16.</p>
<p>While the original Chroma had three filter tune modulation inputs, the
  extended parameters behind Mod 2 and Mod 3 Select and Depth are used for two
  more inputs, Mod 4 and Mod 5. Also, the Mod 1 Depth parameter has an extended
  <span class="page" onclick="page('Filter_mod_steps')">Mod 1 Steps</span> parameter behind it, which works just like the
  analogous parameter in the Oscillator section. Since the filter can be used
  as an oscillator, the filter&rsquo;s modulation depth controls have high
  resolution around zero like the oscillator&rsquo;s, to allow for very slight
  vibrato.</p>
