<p><em>unit:</em> A quantity that represents the scaling of a <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_control_signal')">control signal</span>
value. For note pitch and <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_glide')">glide</span> output, one unit equals 32 semitones, so the
Digital Chroma&rsquo;s keyboard is two units long. <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_sweep')">Sweep</span> signals
always have a +1 unit maximum values, but some shapes are <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_unipolar')">unipolar</span> while
others are <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_bipolar')">bipolar</span>. <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_envelope')">Envelopes</span> go from zero to one if fixed
amplitude, or up to two if modulated by velocity or pedal. <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_lever')">Levers</span> are
&plusmn;1 unit, or 0 to 1 unit if only one side of the lever is used.
<span class="popup" onclick="popup('_pedal')">Pedals</span> are 0 to 1 unit. Finally, modulation depths are documented in
terms of how much they vary what they modulate for each unit of input.</p>
