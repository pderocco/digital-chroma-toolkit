<p><em>amplifier:</em> A sound processing module within a <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_voice')">voice</span> that
controls the volume. Each voice has two, one in each <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_channel')">channel</span>. Each
amplifier&rsquo;s volume is controlled by the sum of two envelope mod inputs,
multiplied by a post mod input typically used for a pedal or a <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_sweep')">sweep</span>
tremolo.</p>
<p>An amplifier is usually used at the output of the voice, in which case it
also includes a pan control that can be modulated. But the B channel amplifier
is used in certain <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_patch')">patches</span> to control the mix of the A and B
<span class="popup" onclick="popup('_oscillator')">oscillators</span>, in which case the pan portion is disabled.</p>
