<h1>Program organization</h1>
<p>The <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_parameter')">parameters</span> that define a sound are collected together into
  <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_program')">programs</span>, which are stored in files in the Digital Chroma&rsquo;s
  memory. (The original Chroma stored them in a battery-backed-up CMOS RAM; the
  Digital Chroma uses an internal flash memory file system.)</p>
<p>The original Chroma stored fifty programs in its memory. With the panel in
  Program Select mode, pressing a numbered switch selects the corresponding
  program, copying it into the Main <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_instrument')">instrument</span>, which controls the sound
  played from the keyboard. Any edits made to the sound are made to this copy,
  and don&rsquo;t get saved unless the user presses STORE followed by a
  numbered switch (or presses STORE twice to save under the current program
  number). The display shows a MODIFIED indicator if a change is made to the
  program; this is turned off if the changed program is stored.</p>
<p>The Digital Chroma expands the memory to nine banks of fifty programs, so
  the program number display shows three-digit numbers instead of two-digit
  numbers. Pressing a numbered switch (in Program Select mode) selects a
  program in the current bank. To change banks, you hold PROG SELECT like a
  shift key, and press one of the first nine numbered switches. The display
  changes to 100, 200, 300, etc., to indicate that it is waiting for a program
  number to be selected; the next number switch (after releasing PROG SELECT)
  selects a program within the new bank.</p>
<p>Similarly, pressing STORE followed by a number stores into the current bank.
  To store into a different bank, you hold STORE like a shift key, press the
  bank number, release STORE, and press the program number. (You can also
  select the bank first with PROG SELECT, as described above, and then press
  STORE and finally the program number, but that&rsquo;s less efficient.)</p>
