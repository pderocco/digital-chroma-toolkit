<h1>MIDI pitch bend</h1>
<p>The Pitch Bend message isn&rsquo;t used for the usual pitch bend control,
  lever 2. This is because Pitch Bend is supposed to be scaled not by a
  program parameter but by <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_RPN')">RPN</span> 0,0. The MIDI inputs do support Pitch Bend
  and RPN 0,0, but the resulting bend value is added to the output of both
  glide generators, rather than being treated as a general modulation
  source.</p>
<p>If an explicit <span class="page" onclick="page('MIDI_polyphonic_controls')">Note Select</span> control is used to
  address Pitch Bend to a specific note, the range comes from an RPN 0,0 whose
  Data MSB is also preceded by a Note Select control. The latter note number is
  ignored; there is only one range for poly controls, and one range for mono
  controls, and the two differently scaled values are added together. This is
  different from all other polyphonic controls, which are overridden if a mono
  control is received.</p>
<p>When MPE is enabled, the master Pitch Bend is scaled by RPN 0,0 received on
  the master channel, the individual Pitch Bend is scaled by RPN 0,0 received
  on any member channel, and the two are added together, as required by the
  MPE specification. Any other control received on the master channel
  overrides the same control received on any member channel, rather than adding
  to it.</p>
