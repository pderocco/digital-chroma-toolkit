<p><em>panel mode:</em> In the Digital Chroma, the basic mode that the control
panel is in, which determines what the numbered switches do. The mode normally
used while playing is <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_program_select_mode')">PROG SELECT</span> mode, in which the
numbers select <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_program')">programs</span>. While editing, the panel is in
<span class="popup" onclick="popup('_parameter_select_mode')">PARAM SELECT</span> mode, in which the numbers select
<span class="popup" onclick="popup('_parameter')">parameters</span> and connect them to the
<span class="popup" onclick="popup('_parameter_control')">PARAMETER CONTROL</span>. The COPY FROM A and COPY FROM B modes
allow parameter values to be copied from another program, or between the A and
B parameters.</p>
<p>The panel mode has no bearing on the Toolkit.</p>
