<h1>Amplifier controls</h1>
<p>In the original Chroma, the architecture of each <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_channel')">channel's</span> volume
  control is simple: two <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_envelope')">envelopes</span> are selected and scaled by their
  corresponding depth <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_parameter')">parameter</span>, added together, and then multiplied by an
  optional third modulation source such as a pedal. The Digital Chroma keeps
  this same structure, but provides more third modulation choices, and allows
  its depth to be varied.</p>
<p>There is also one more choice for the first two modulation sources, called
  &ldquo;fixed&rdquo;, which outputs a perpetual value of one unit. It is
  intended for use in the B channel, in those <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_patch')">patches</span> which mix the B
  amplifier output with the A oscillator output. In the original Chroma, you
  had to waste an envelope for this purpose.</p>
<h2>Panning controls</h2>
<p>The channel&rsquo;s output can be panned between the left and right
  instrument outputs under control of the extended Pan parameter. It has
  extended modulation select and depth controls. For those patches which have
  independent outputs from the A and B channels, the two channels can be panned
  separately; for those patches which have only a single output, the B channel
  panning is ignored.</p>
<p>There is also a <span class="page" onclick="page('Common_link_spread')">Link Spread</span> parameter, which only takes
  effect when a link is in effect. If set to something other than zero, it
  constrains the entire pan range toward one side or the other. For instance,
  if it is set to 45&deg;, the regular pan control in the Main sound will be
  centered around 45 degrees, and will therefeore pan from center to 90 degrees
  to the right; the Link sound will be coaxed to the opposite side. If set to
  90&deg;, the Main sound will be forced all the way to the right, regardless
  of its own pan control, and the Link sound will be forced all the way to the
  left. There is also a <span class="page" onclick="page('Control_pan_spread')">pan spread</span> parameter, which does
  the same thing when the <span class="page" onclick="page('Control_voice_count')">voice count</span> parameter is used
  to assign multiple voices per note.</p>
