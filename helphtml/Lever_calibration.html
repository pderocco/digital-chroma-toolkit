<h1>Lever calibration</h1>
<p>The levers are mechanical potentiometers which produce varying voltages
  which are measured by the Digital Chroma&rsquo;s input scanning processor.
  Like all potentiometers, they have fairly gross manufacturing tolerances, so
  the Digital Chroma measures the actual range of voltages that they produce,
  and stores these values in the calibration file.</p>
<p>This calibration is normally performed when the Digital Chroma Upgrade Kit
  is first installed. If you ever discover that the levers don&rsquo;t quite
  reach their full &plusmn;1 unit range, or that they don&rsquo;t return
  exactly to zero, or that they have a significant dead zone at either end,
  they need to be recalibrated. (If the nut holding the potentiometer has
  loosened, you might want to fix that first.) The levers are recalibrated by
  selecting calibration 26, which records the current lever positions as the
  proper zero points, and then moving both levers through their entire
  mechanical range.</p>
<p>While moving the levers, the display shows numbers proportional to their
  actual voltages, on an arbitrary 0 to 1000 scale. You can see that the
  levers don&rsquo;t cover the full voltage range of the analog inputs, but
  the calibration compensates for the varying range. If you see numbers that go
  all the way down to 0 or all the way up to 1000, then the potentiometer
  isn&rsquo;t rotated properly, and needs a mechanical readjustment. You can
  still use that lever, but there will be a dead zone at one end of its
  mechanical range.</p>
