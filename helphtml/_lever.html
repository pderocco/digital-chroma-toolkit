<p><em>lever:</em> One of the two controllers to the left of the keyboard on
  the Digital Chroma. The <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_control_signal')">control signals</span> generated by them
  can be used to modulate anything, but typically the left lever is used to
  control <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_sweep')">sweep</span> amplitude, and indirectly vibrato, while the right is used
  to modulate <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_oscillator')">oscillator</span> pitch, for pitch bend. This assignment works well
  because the thumb and forefinger can bend the pitch either way, while the
  middle finger can pull for vibrato.<p>
<p>Note that each side of a lever&rsquo;s range can be used as a separate
  modulation source, with names starting with &ldquo;&ndash;lever&rdquo; or
  &ldquo;+lever&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The physical polarities of the levers (which direction is considered
  positive) can be set by <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_global_parameter')">global parameters</span> according to
  the player&rsquo;s preference.</p>
