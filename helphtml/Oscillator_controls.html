<h1>Oscillator controls</h1>
<p>The basic parameter controlling the <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_oscillator')">oscillator</span> is Tune, which is scaled
  in semitones. Its value is shown as the note number played by the middle C
  key, by default &ldquo;C5&rdquo; (since the MIDI note range is represented as &ldquo;C0&rdquo; to
  &ldquo;G10&rdquo;). The Digital Chroma adds the extended <span class="page" onclick="page('Control_tune_shift')">tune shift</span>
  <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_parameter')">parameter</span>, which has two functions depending upon its polarity: for
  positive values, it introduces a varying amount of stretch to the tuning; for
  negative values, it introduces a varying amount of randomness to the tuning.
  The latter is useful for simulating the out-of-tune-ness of the original
  Chroma, but one or the other should generally be used in modest quantities to
  avoid a dry sound.</p>
<p>Although Tune Shift is an extended parameter behind the Tune parameter, it
  is actually a control parameter, meaning that it has a single value that
  applies to both <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_channel')">channels</span>. There is also a single
  <span class="page" onclick="page('Control_detune')">detune</span> control parameter, inherited from the original
  Chroma, which detunes only the B channel relative to the A channel. Unlike
  the original Chroma, which had a fixed pitch detune, the Digital Chroma has
  an extended Detune Scale parameter which allows for a fixed Hertz detune for
  a constant beat frequency, and a half-scale detune in which the beat
  frequency doubles with each two-octave increase in pitch.</p>
<p>When a <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_link_program')">link</span> is in effect, there is also a
  <span class="page" onclick="page('Common_link_detune')">Link Detune</span> parameter, which detunes the Main and Link
  sounds in opposite directions. When the <span class="page" onclick="page('Control_voice_count')">voice count</span>
  parameter is used to allocate multiple voices to each note, there is also a
  <span class="page" onclick="page('Control_tune_spread')">tune spread</span> control parameter, which causes the tuning
  of the voices to be spread out by an adjustable amount. These both use
  half-scale detuning.</p>
<p class="extra">Note that all these detunings (and the master tuning) are
  applied both to the oscillators and the filters, in case the latter are used
  as ocillators.</p>
<p>The modulation sources in the original Chroma included the glide,
  <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_sweep')">sweep</span> and <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_envelope')">envelope</span> generators of both channels, as well as the
  <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_lever')">levers</span>, <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_pedal')">pedals</span>, velocity and pressure. The Digital Chroma
  is more versatile in that it allows you to use either the full bipolar range
  of either lever, or to choose one side or the other of the lever range. There
  is even a noise modulation input, which is useful with the Steps parameter
  described below.</p>
<p>While the original Chroma had three pitch modulation inputs, the extended
  parameters behind Mod 2 and 3 Select and Depth are used for two more inputs,
  Mod 4 and 5. Also, the Mod 1 Depth parameter has an extended Mod 1 Steps
  parameter behind it, which does one of two things: it can quantize the
  modulation (after scaling by the depth) to semitones, or any interval up to
  fifths, or it can sample it either by one of the sweep generators. If
  something like a decaying envelope is used as a modulation source, quantizing
  will yield apparent steps that slow down as the envelope approaches zero,
  while sampling will yield steps that get smaller in amplitude as the envelope
  approaches zero. When noise is sampled by a sweep generator, the well-known
  noise-into-sample-and-hold effect is attained.</p>
<p>The old Chroma scaled the three modulations differently, so that one could
  get very slight vibratos, and also get extreme modulation which is useful
  when the <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_patch')">patch</span> parameter enables phase sync. The Digital Chroma scales
  them all the same, but the mod depth scales are nonlinear, providing high
  resolution around zero, and larger steps at larger values.</p>
