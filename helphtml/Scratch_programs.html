<h1>Scratch programs</h1>
<p>The original Chroma introduced the concept of the &ldquo;scratch&rdquo;
  program, which was a <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_program')">program</span> in which all <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_parameter')">parameters</span> had
  default values, and those values were chosen to yield a raw sawtooth wave
  sound, as a useful place to start programming. A scratch program has most
  parameter set to zero, or to 1 if that is the minimum parameter value, but
  there are some exceptions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The two envelope Decay Time parameters are set to
    &ldquo;infinite&rdquo;.</li>
  <li>The filter Tune parameter is set to maximum, for a wide-open filter.</li>
  <li>The volume Mod 1 Depth parameter is set to 0db, for a nominal modulation
    by envelope 1A.</li>
  <li>Although the various mod depths are set to zero, their corresponding mod
    selects are preset to different useful choices.</li>
  </ul>
<p>In the original Chroma, the only way to obtain a scratch sound was to turn
  on both EDIT A and EDIT B, hold PARAM SELECT down, and press each number
  switch; doing so would reset the corresponding parameter to its default
  value. The Digital Chroma still supports this, and allows extended parameters
  to be reset by holding SET SPLIT in Parameter Select mode and pressing
  number switches. But you can also press SET SPLIT in Program Select mode and
  then press 25 to clear all parameters. Note that this doesn&rsquo;t actually change
  the program number in the display.</p>
<p>In the original Chroma, all fifty stored programs always existed, because
  they were stored in fixed areas of the non-volatile CMOS RAM. The Digital
  Chroma, on the other hand, stores programs in files on a flash file system
  (very much like an ordinary thumb drive), and it represents a scratch
  program by the absence of the corresponding file. If you select a
  non-existent program, you get a scratch program; if you store a scratch
  program over an existing program, it deletes that file.</p>
<p>Since &ldquo;scratch&rdquo; is therefore an easily recognizable condition,
  not just some magic set of a couple hundred different parameter values, the
  program number display has two annunciators in it, one saying SCRATCH and
  the other saying MODIFIED. (The original Chroma just turned on a decimal
  point in the seven-segment readout to indicate MODIFIED.)</p>
