<h1>Sequence Program</h1>
<p>In performance, it is sometimes useful to be able to switch from one
  <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_program')">program</span> to another under control of a <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_footswitch')">footswitch</span>. The Sequence Program
  Bank and Number <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_parameter')">parameters</span> allow each program to contain a
  &ldquo;pointer&rdquo; to another program, which will be switched to when the
  Sequence Program footswitch is pressed and released. It is a fairly limited
  feature&mdash;after all, if program 119 sequences to program 123, then
  program 119 always sequences to program 123, regardless of context. But given
  the 450-program storage space, if you want program 119 to sequence to program
  137 in a different context, you can store a copy of program 119 somewhere
  else, with a different Sequence Program parameter.</p>
<p>The Sequence Program function is invoked by pressing and releasing the
  Sequence Program footswitch, without any intervening panel switch presses;
  the change occurs when the footswitch is released. The Sequence Program
  parameters are set by holding the footswitch like a shift key and pressing a
  number. This is as it was in the original Chroma; in the Digital Chroma, this
  implies a sequence to a program in the same bank as the main program, and is
  represented by a Sequence Program Bank parameter of zero. To sequence to a
  program in any specific different bank, you first hold PROG SELECT like a
  shift key and press the bank number (just as you would if you were going to
  select a program in that bank), then hold the footswitch and press the
  program number. In this case, the Sequence Program Bank parameter is set to
  the bank number, from 1 to 9.</p>
<p>The Digital Chroma also allows a &ldquo;sequence to previous&rdquo;. If you
  hold the Sequence Program footswitch like a shift key and press PROG SELECT,
  it sets both the Sequence Program Bank and Number parameters to zero. When
  you subsequently press and release the footswitch, it selects the program
  that was in effect before the current one was selected (even if it was
  selected manually), including any modifications that may have been made to
  that previous program.</p>
<p>When the Sequence Program parameter was changed in the original Chroma, it
  was changed in the stored program as well as in the Main <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_instrument')">instrument</span>, even
  if they were different. The Digital Chroma only does this if the program in
  the Main instrument is unmodified; actually, it changes the two parameters,
  and then does a Store operation, so the program MODIFIED indicator still
  remains off. If the program was already modified (or
  <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_scratch_program')">scratch</span>), the Sequence Program parameters are changed but
  the result isn&rsquo;t stored; it is up to the user to do the Store
  operation, if the other unrelated changes should be kept.</p>
