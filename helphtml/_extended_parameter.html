<p><em>extended parameter:</em> On the Digital Chroma&rsquo;s control panel, a
<span class="popup" onclick="popup('_parameter')">parameter</span> that wasn&rsquo;t present in the original Chroma, and that is
accessed by pressing <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_SET_SPLIT')">SET SPLIT</span> before the numbered switch. This nearly
doubles the number of possible parameters. In the Toolkit, no distinction is
made between regular and extended parameters.</p>
