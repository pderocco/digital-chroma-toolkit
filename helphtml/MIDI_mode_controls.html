<p>The following special Control Changes are also recognized on input (the
actual value is ignored):</p>
<table class="vt">
  <tr>
    <td width="5%"/>
    <td width="10%">CC120</td>
    <td width="20%">All Sounds Off</td>
    <td>All notes are turned off, and all voices are forcibly squelched and
      returned to the idle state.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td>CC121</td>
    <td>All Controllers Off</td>
    <td>All controls are set to their nominal values. Bend, ribbon, pan, link
      spread and link detune are set to midscale, volume and link balance are
      set to 90, portamento switch (glide enable) is turned on, and everything
      else is set to zero.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td>CC123</td>
    <td>All Notes Off</td>
    <td>All notes are turned off, but may continue to sound if they have long
      releases or the Sustain control is on.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
<p>The other special Control Changes defined by MIDI, Omni Mode, Mono Mode,
  Poly Mode and Local Control, are not supported. However, when an input port
  is placed in MPE mode, the member channels are effectively placed in Mono
  Mode, because the MPE converter forces each new note to be played on the same
  voice(s) as the last note.</p>
<p>A SET SPLIT panel function is provided that issues All Sounds Off and All
  Controllers Off controls into all MIDI input players, to fix stuck notes and
  controls received from MIDI. Another function does this for the main and
  link players, but follows them with controls that reflect the physical
  control settings, and the global reverb parameters.</p>
