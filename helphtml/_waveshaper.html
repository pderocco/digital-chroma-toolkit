<p><em>waveshaper:</em> A sound processing module that takes the frequency
generated by the <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_oscillator')">oscillator</span> in the same <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_channel')">channel</span>, and turns it into one of
a number of possible wave shapes. The two basic shapes are &ldquo;saws&rdquo;,
which is a pair of sawtooth waves with a phase difference controlled by the
Width parameter, and &ldquo;pulse&rdquo; which is a variable width pulse; the
two have opposite harmonic spectra. The Digital Chroma also adds simple
single-oscillator FM sounds with various carrier to modulator ratios, and can
also modulate a sine wave by the opposite channel&rsquo;s oscillator or
<span class="popup" onclick="popup('_filter')">filter</span> output. Finally, it supports the &ldquo;pink noise&rdquo; and
&ldquo;white noise&rdquo; choices that the original Chroma had, plus an
&ldquo;impulse&rdquo; shape that is useful for pinging a highly
<span class="popup" onclick="popup('_resonance')">resonant</span> filter. These last three choices ignore the width
control, and the noise choices ignore the oscillator input.</p>
