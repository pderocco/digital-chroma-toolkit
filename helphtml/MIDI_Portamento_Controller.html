<h1>MIDI Portamento Controller</h1>
<p>The MIDI Specification defines CC84 as the Portamento Controller, because it
  can be used to control which notes glide to which notes when portamento is
  used polyphonically. But since it isn&rsquo;t only useful when portamento is
  used, the Digital Chroma calls it the Note Select control, and even gives it
  additional functionality. The value is a note number, which modifies the
  following message, and is then consumed so that it has no further effect.
  When used immediately before a Note On, it does one of two things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If the note specified by the Note Select control is already assigned to a
    voice, the voice is reused for the new note. If the old note was still on,
    the envelopes are not retriggered. If glide is enabled, it glides from the
    voice&rsquo;s current pitch.</p>
  <li>If the note doesn&rsquo;t currently have a voice, a new one is assigned.
    If glide is enabled, the Note Select control provides the starting pitch
    for the glide.</li>
  </ul>
<p>This is an imperfect mechanism for controlling the pitches of notes, though.
  If one plays note <i>x</i>, then note <i>y</i>, then moves <i>y</i> to
  <i>x</i>, there would be two notes playing pitch <i>x</i>, and no way to
  address them individually. When such a sequence is given to the Digital
  Chroma, changing note <i>y</i> to <i>x</i> turns off the previous note
  <i>x</i> first, so there is only one note playing <i>x</i>.</p>
<p>Internally, the Digital Chroma maintains a note number remapping table that
  initially maps every note number to itself. The use of Note Select <i>x</i>
  followed by Note On <i>y</i> swaps their mapping, relying on
  <span class="page" onclick="page('MIDI_pitch_controls')">Pitch MSB</span> to specify the actual pitch, if sent out to a
  DAW for recording. When Note Select <i>x</i> is used while note <i>x</i> is
  still on, the Note On <i>y</i> will be translated into a duplicate Note On,
  thus changing the pitch without retriggering the envelopes.</p>
<p>Monophonic playing can be forced by preceding each Note On with a Note
  Select containing the previous note number, and internally they will all end
  up mapping to the same note number, using Pitch MSB for the pitches. Use of
  this feature gradually scrambles the note remapping table, but this is
  invisible to the user unless one sends the notes to an external DAW via the
  MIDI device port and examines the note numbers. However the table is reset to
  its unscrambled state on receipt of an <span class="page" onclick="page('MIDI_mode_controls')">All Sounds Off</span> or
  a <span class="page" onclick="page('MIDI_Reset')">Reset</span>.</p>
