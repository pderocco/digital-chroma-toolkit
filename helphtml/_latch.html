<p><em>latch:</em> One of the functions of the left <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_footswitch')">footswitch</span>, under
control of the Footswitch Mode <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_parameter')">parameter</span>. In this mode, the footswitch
performs a function similar to sostenuto in a piano, but more powerful.
Pressing the footswitch &ldquo;latches&rdquo; the notes that are held, and the
state of the sustain footswitch, for all voices currently sounding.
Subsequently, the sustain footswitch can be released, and notes can be played
completely independently of the latched notes. When the latch footswitch is
released, the latched notes are no longer latched, but will continue to sound
if the sustain footswitch is held.</p>
