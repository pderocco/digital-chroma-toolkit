<p><em>NRPN:</em> In MIDI, a &ldquo;Registered Parameter Number&rdquo;, which
is a composite control made up of three or four Control Change messages,
providing access to a potentially huge number of parameters that are defined by

them. The Digital Chroma supports two of them, Pitch Bend Range, and MIDI
Polyphonic Expression (MPE), on input only.</p>
