<p><em>parameter:</em> A numeric value that is part of a <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_program')">program</span>, that
controls some single aspect of a sound. Every parameter has a name, a range of
internal numeric values which are used over MIDI, a default value in a
<span class="popup" onclick="popup('_scratch_program')">scratch program</span>, and a more user-friendly representation of each possible
numeric value. For instance, an oscillator pitch is shown using note symbols
like &ldquo;G#4&rdquo;, while a modulation selector value is shown as the name
of the modulation source, like &ldquo;envelope 2A&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Parameters are categorized as <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_selector_parameter')">selector parameters</span>,
which have distinct settings, and <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_variable_parameter')">variable parameters</span>,
which represent a continuous range of values with a certain resolution. On the
Digital Chroma, parameters are also categorized as &ldquo;regular&rdquo;, if
they were included in the original Chroma, or
&ldquo;<span class="popup" onclick="popup('_extended_parameter')">extended</span>&rdquo;, if they are new.</p>
