<p><em>footswitch:</em> An on/off control operated by the foot. The Digital
Chroma has a dual footswitch assembly in which the right footswitch is for
sustain, and the left footswitch can be used as a latch (similar to sostenuto),
or a gate, or a <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_glide')">glide</span> enable. It also has a separate <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_sequence_program')">sequence program</span>
footswitch, which selects whatever <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_program')">program</span> is specified by the Sequence
Program <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_parameter')">parameter</span> in the current program.</p>
<p>The Digital Chroma calls these controls &ldquo;footswitches&rdquo; since the
term &ldquo;pedal&rdquo; is reserved for the variable <span class="popup" onclick="popup('_pedal')">pedals</span> used for
volume and expression.</p>
