<h1>MIDI performance controls</h1>
<p>Each lever generates two non-overlapping {_unipolar} controls, such that
  when one is nonzero the other is zero. However, from MIDI the two sides of
  each lever are two completely independent controls. When a program uses lever
  1 as a modulation source, it is really subtracting the \-lever value
  from the +lever value. When it uses +lever or \-lever, it only listens
  to that one control. Note that {_global_parameter global parameters}
  determines the physical polarity of each lever, and should be set based on
  the performer's preference.</p>
<p>The pedals normally generate unipolar controls, and the ribbon generates a
  {_bipolar} control. They too have global parameters to invert them, to allow
  the Digital Chroma to be used with as many different devices as possible.
  There are also global parameters to support custom bipolar pedals using two
  controls for each, but if this isn't done, the \-pedal 1 and
  \-pedal 2 controls could be used by other completely independent
  external controllers.</p>
<p>The Volume control comes from the VOLUME slider, and has an x<sup>2</sup>
  curve in the player. The nominal value is 90, which is 6db below maximum. The
  LSB isn't supported.</p>
<p>On input, the Pan control, when set to a nonzero value, reduces the
  available pan range for the player's stereo output, nudging or forcing
  it to the left or right. Nothing in the Digital Chroma generates this. The
  LSB isn't supported.</p>
