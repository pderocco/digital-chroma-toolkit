<h1>MIDI note semantics</h1>
<p>According to the MIDI spec, Note On and Note Off are supposed to be
  balanced. The Digital Chroma ignores Note Off messages for notes that are
  already off, but does play Note On messages for notes that are already on.
  This is because they communicate the useful idea that the note should be
  retriggered without giving the envelopes the chance to be reset to zero
  first. Regardless of how many times a note has been triggered in this way,
  they are all played using the same voice(s), so it still only takes one Note
  Off to turn the note off.</p>
<p>The Digital Chroma never generates duplicate Note On messages from its
  keyboard, but if it receives them from an external input device while
  recording, they will be passed on to the MIDI Record Output.</p>
