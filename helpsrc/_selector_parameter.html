<p><em>selector parameter:</em> A {_parameter} that represents a set of
discrete choices, such as a modulation source. In the Toolkit, it is
represented as a set of {_button buttons}, one for each choice. On the Digital
Chroma's control panel, it is treated like any other parameter, but the
panel {_tapper} may be configured to tap as the {_parameter_control} goes from
one setting to another.</p>
<p><i>Also:</i> {_variable_parameter}</p>
