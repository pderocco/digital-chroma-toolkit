<h1>Toolkit gestures</h1>
<p>There are only a few simple gestures that you use to interact with the
  Toolkit. It was designed with touch in mind, but can be used with a mouse as
  well, although only the left mouse button is used. The gestures are:</p>
<table class="vt">
  <tr>
    <td width="2%"/>
    <td width="15%"><i>tap</i></td>
    <td>Touching momentarily. You can also do this with the left mouse button,
      but these pages always refer to "tapping" for simplicity.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td><i>long-press</i></td>
    <td>Touching for more than half a second.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td><i>drag</i></td>
    <td>Touching, sliding somewhere else, and releasing.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td><i>long-drag</i></td>
    <td>Touching for more than half a second, sliding somewhere else, and
      releasing.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
<p>Except for the last one, these are all standard gestures, but what they do
  depends upon what kind of {Toolkit_controls control} you touch or click:</p>
<table class="vt">
  <tr>
    <td width="2%"/>
    <td width="15%"><i>program button</i></td>
    <td>Tapping selects the {_program} in that location, so that you can play
      it. Long-pressing it displays a {_popup} that lets you do various other
      things with the program, or with that program location. Dragging it onto
      an empty program slot moves it to that location, while dragging it onto
      an existing program swaps them.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td><i>program bank button</i></td>
    <td>Tapping selects that bank, so that you can then select a program within
      it. Long-pressing it splits the screen and displays the bank in the lower
      half, or changes the bank in the lower half if it is already split.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td><i>Program Info button</i></td>
    <td>Tapping this button in the {_Navigation_bar} reloads the current
      program, discarding any edits you may have made. Long-pressing displays a
      popup that lets you do other things, like store the program under its
      current number, change the name, and so on.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td><em>HELP</em> <i>button</i></td>
    <td>Tapping switches to the current tab of the <em>Help</em> screen.
      Long-pressing also navigates to the Home page.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td valign="middle">{question.png height=24} <i>button</i><br></td>
    <td>Tapping switches to the current tab of the <em>Help</em> screen, and
      navigates to the help page for whatever contained the button.
      Long-pressing it opens it in a new tab.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td><i>cluster button</i></td>
    <td>Tapping displays a popup that provides access to all the
      {_parameter parameters} in that {_cluster}. Long-pressing it resets all
      the parameters in the cluster to their {_default_value default values}.
      Dragging it onto another cluster button of the same type copies all the
      parameters; if this is done between two paired A and B channel clusters,
      it also {_gang gangs} them together, so that the A channel controls
      operate both channels in parallel. Tapping a ganged B cluster (labeled
      "=") ungangs them. Long-dragging a cluster button onto another of the
      same type first resets the source to its defaults, but then swaps the
      original values of those parameters with the target cluster.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td><i>value button</i></td>
    <td>Tapping sets a parameter to that value. Long-pressing resets it to its
      default value instead.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td><i>slider</i></td>
    <td>Dragging horizontally changes the value. Long-pressing resets the
      parameter to its default value. Tapping usually does nothing, but in a
      few cases, it sets the parameter to a commonly used non-default value,
      like 50% for a pulse width. This is called its "significant"
      value.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td><i>help link</i></td>
    <td>Tapping shows a different page in the current tab if the link is blue,
      or pops up a definition if green. Long-pressing a blue link shows it in a
      new tab.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td><i>help tab</i></td>
    <td>Tapping switches to that tab. Long-pressing closes the tab, and if it
      was the only tab, opens a new tab on the Home page. Dragging horizontally
      scrolls the tabs, if there are more than fit onto the screen.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td><i>help page</i></td>
    <td>Dragging vertically scrolls the page, if it is longer than the screen.
      Long-pressing in the bottom half (not on a link) scrolls to the bottom of
      the page, and long-pressing in the top half scrolls to the top.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
