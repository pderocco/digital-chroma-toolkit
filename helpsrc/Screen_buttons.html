<h1>Screen buttons</h1>
<p>{screen-buttons.png width=192}</p>
<p>At any time you can {_tap} one of these to display the corresponding screen
  in the rest of the Toolkit window.</p>
<p>The {Programs_screen <em>PROGRAMS</em>} screen is where you select
  {_program programs}, rearrange them, modify their names or descriptions,
  delete them, or set up {_link_program links} to them. It normally shows one
  bank of programs, but has buttons to select any of the nine banks, and can be
  split between two banks so that you can move programs between them. Normally,
  the current bank is selected, meaning that it will show whatever bank
  contains the {_current_program}, even if you select a program in a different
  bank from the Chroma's control panel.</p>
<p>The {Editor_screen <em>EDITOR</em>} screen is where you edit programs. It is
  by far the most complicated screen, because the Digital Chroma is a pretty
  complicated instrument.</p>
<p>The {Tools_screen <em>TOOLS</em>} screen is where you manipulate the
  {_global_parameter global parameters} that control the overall operation of
  the Digital Chroma, and perform other utility functions.</p>
<p>The {Help_screen <em>HELP</em>} screen is what you're looking at now.
  Complete documentation is provided for both the Toolkit and the Digital
  Chroma itself.</p>
<p class="extra">If you {_long-press long-press} this button, it selects this
  screen and switches to the Home page.</p>
<p>You can also click on various {question.png height=16}
  buttons in other screens, to switch to this screen and bring up a relevant
  help page.</p>
<h2>Hotkeys</h2>
<p>Pressing <b>P</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>T</b>, or <b>H</b> on the keyboard is
  another way to switch screens.</p>
