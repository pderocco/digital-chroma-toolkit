<h1>COMMON sequence program</h1>
<p>This controls what {_program} will be selected when the
  {_sequence_program Sequence Program} footswitch is pressed. It can be either
  a 1- or 2-digit number to step to a program in the same bank as the current
  program, or a 3-digit number to step to a program in a specific bank. The
  difference is meaningful when the current program is stored in a different
  bank.</p>
<p>This can also be set to "previous", which means that the
  footswitch will re-select whatever was selected before the current program.
  This can be useful if you have a program that you want to be able to step to,
  and then step back to wherever it came from. For instance, programs 1, 2, and
  3 might be set to step to program 50, and program 50 set to revert to
  previous, in which case pressing the footswitch twice could step 1-50-1,
  2-50-2, or 3-50-3. When it steps to "previous", it restores any
  unsaved edits that may have been in effect in that earlier program.</p>

<h2>Toolkit</h2>
<p>This is contained in the {Common_sequence_cluster <i>sequence</i> cluster}
  within the {Common_section}, but this only allows it to be viewed, and
  possibly reset to its default value of "previous" by
  {_long-press long-pressing} the <i>program</i> button. In general, it is set
  from the {Programs_screen} by {_long-press long-pressing} the program you
  want to sequence to, to view the {Program_popup}, and then pressing the
  "sequence program" button.</p>
<p>Note that if this is changed in an otherwise unmodified program, the
  modification is also automatically stored, so the program continues to appear
  "unmodified". This reduces the number of steps needed to set up a chain of
  sequenced programs. If the program was already modified, it is up to you to
  store it, if you want all the changes stored.</p>

<h2>Chroma panel</h2>
<p>A 1- or 2-digit sequence program is set up by holding the Sequence Program
  footswitch and pressing a numbered switch on the right panel. A 3-digit
  sequence program is set up by holding PROGRAM SELECT and pressing the bank
  number, then holding the footswitch and pressing the program number. Neither
  operation actually switches to the new program; you have to press and release
  the footswitch to do that.</p>
<p>This can also be set to "previous" by holding the footswitch and
  pressing PROGRAM SELECT.</p>
<p>Note that if this is changed in an otherwise unmodified program, the
  modification is also automatically stored, so the program continues to appear
  "unmodified". If the program was already modified, it is up to
  you to store it, if you want all the changes stored.</p>

<h2>MIDI</h2>
<p>This is accessed as two separate parameters. The bank is set via {_NRPN}
  0,11, and the program by NRPN 0,12.</p>
