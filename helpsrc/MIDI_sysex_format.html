<h1>MIDI Sysex format</h1>

<p>Some MIDI operations need to carry bulk data. For instance, the Program Set
  operation contains the actual program data, rather than loading it from a
  file. Such operations are represented by a System Exclusive (Sysex) message
  containing the data, an optional Bank MSB for those that specify a program
  number, and an {_NRPN} that indicates what the data means and what channel
  (if any) it is associated with. Any Digital Chroma NRPN consumes the Sysex
  data, even if it didn't use it, so an NRPN with no Sysex before it
  won't reuse an earlier one. Any editor that interprets Sysex messages
  from the Digital Chroma must do the same thing.</p>
<p>All Digital Chroma Sysex messages share a common format:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The System Exclusive status byte 240.</li>
  <li>The three-byte manufacturer's ID, 0,0,20, referring to Perfect
    Fretworks.</li>
  <li>The ASCII code 68, which is a capital D, for Digital Chroma.</p>
  <li>Zero or more bytes of bulk data, whose interpretation is determined by
    the following NRPN. Zero bytes is equivalent to no Sysex at all.</p>
  <li>The 247 End of System Exclusive status byte.</li>
  </ul>
<p>On input, any non-real-time status byte will signal the end of a Sysex
  message, since the MIDI specification doesn't literally require the use
  of an End of System Exclusive. On output, End of System Exclusive is always
  sent, since some programs wrongly assume that it must be there.</p>
<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p>Often, messages carrying bulk data need to be addressed to a specific MIDI
  channel, but Sysex messages don't contain channel numbers. It is
  possible to put a channel number into a Sysex, but there is no standard
  location for the channel number, so external software (a sequencer or DAW)
  that tries to move a track from one MIDI channel number to another will
  successfully change all the channel messages but not update the Sysex
  messages. Using a Sysex followed by an NRPN eliminates this problem.</p>
<p>The only danger is that the Sysex is only bound to its NRPN by proximity. In
  a multi-track sequence, there is a tiny possibility that a Sysex/NRPN on one
  channel will get interleaved with a Sysex/NRPN on another channel, resulting
  in one NRPN using the wrong Sysex and the other getting no Sysex at all. But
  there is only one Sysex message that can ever appear in a recorded sequence
  (Program Set), and it only appears if one starts recording with a modified
  program, or uses Undo or Redo to go back or forward to a modified program. So
  avoid doing those things, and the possibility of this problem drops from tiny
  to zero.</p>
<h2>Sysex data formats</h2>
<p>On input to the Digital Chroma, any NRPN that expects a preceding Sysex is
  ignored if the contents of the Sysex are invalid. The Sysex may take a number
  of different formats, depending upon the NRPN:</p>
<ul>
  <li>{MIDI_text_sysex text}</li>
  <li>{MIDI_time_sysex time}</li>
  <li>{MIDI_timestamp_sysex timestamp}</li>
  <li>{MIDI_metadata_sysex metadata}</li>
  <li>{MIDI_program_sysex program}</li>
  </ul>
