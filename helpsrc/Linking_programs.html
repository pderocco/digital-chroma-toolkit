<h1>Linking programs</h1>
<p>If the {_current_program} is {_link_program linked} to another, you can
  change most of the link-related {_parameter parameters} in the
  {Common_link_cluster}. But if you want to create a new link, or change what
  program is linked to, you must do that from the <em>Programs</em> screen by
  {_long-press long-pressing} the desired link target to see the
  {Program_popup}, and using one of the seven link {_button buttons} there.</p>
