<h1>ENVELOPE attack cluster</h1>
<p>{envelope-attack-cluster.png width=373}</p>
<p>This contains a {Envelope_attack_time <i>time</i>} {_slider} to set the time
  it takes for the envelope to rise to its peak. The
  {Envelope_attack_mod_select <i>mod select</i>} {_button buttons} and
  {Envelope_attack_mod_depth <i>mod depth</i>} {_slider} allow the attack time
  to be modulated by either {_lever} or {_pedal}, the note pitch, the
  {_velocity}, or the optional pressure sensor. It can also be modulated by its
  own value, which changes the shape of the attack curve. Positive modulation
  increases the attack time, negative modulation decreases it.</p>
<p>This also includes the {Envelope_attack_conservation <i>conservation</i>}
  parameter, which determines how much of the previous note's leftover
  envelope is added to the amplitude of the new envelope when a note is
  retriggered. It has six choices, from none to 50%, where the higher settings
  cause the envelope amplitude to grow with each restrike (but still limited to
  two {_unit units}). The "truncate" setting does the opposite,
  forcing the envelope to zero at the start of each note.</p>
