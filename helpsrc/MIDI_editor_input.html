<h1>MIDI editor input</h1>
<p>An editor like the Toolkit can also control the Digital Chroma by sending
  messages to it. All program and parameter {_NRPN NRPNs} are supported,
  including queries, as are the few miscellaneous messages for accessing the
  Digital Chroma's clock, or invoking Undo/Redo. The editor input
  channel doesn't recognize notes or controls, though. If the editor
  channel conflicts with external or playback input, the editor takes
  precedence.</p>
