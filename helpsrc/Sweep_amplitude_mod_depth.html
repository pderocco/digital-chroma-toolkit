<h1>SWEEP amplitude mod depth</h1>
<p>These control the amount that the amplitude of each {_sweep} generator is
  modulated.</p>
<p>The sweep amplitude is normally 100%, and its effective amplitude is
  controlled by the modulation depth where the sweep is used, e.g., the
  {_oscillator} mod input. This modulation parameter simply controls how much
  the {Sweep_amplitude_mod_select selected parameter} dynamically affects the
  amplitude. When this is set to "off" the sweep is at a fixed
  nominal value. When this is raised to 100%, the mod source can vary it from
  zero to 100%, or \-100% to 100% for bipolar controls.</p>
<p>If the {Sweep_amplitude_mod_select mod select} is one of the delay choices,
  the delay envelope goes from \-1 to +1 unit over the delay period, but
  the negative portion is chopped off so there is no sweep signal for the first
  half of the delay. If this depth parameter is reduced to 50%, the delay
  envelope effectively goes from zero to +1 unit, so the sweep starts 
  immediately but rises more slowly.</p>

<h3>Unipolar modulation</h3>
<p>Most mod sources have a 0 to 1 {_unit} range. The following graphs show the
  response at various positive and negative depths:<p>
<table class="p0">
  <tr>
    <td width="5%"/>
    <td>
      {sweep-ampl-mod-graph-unipolar.png width=700}
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
<p>The blue lines represent 0 units of input and output, and the green lines
  represent 1 unit of input and output. The red dots show where the curve
  pivots around, which is different for positive and negative depths. (These
  dots aren't shown in the graph in the cluster popup.)</p>

<h3>Bipolar modulation</h3>
<p>Some mod sources, like the levers, have a \-1 to +1 unit range. The
  following graphs show the response at various positive and negative
  depths:<p>
<table class="p0">
  <tr>
    <td width="5%"/>
    <td>
      {sweep-ampl-mod-graph-bipolar.png width=700}
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>

<h3>Pitch modulation</h3>
<p>The pitch varies from \-1 to almost +1 unit across the keyboard, but
  can go further with octave transposition, and further still via MIDI. The
  darker regions represent the notes outside the normal keyboard range. As you
  can see, the most useful settings are lower values, allowing you to introduce
  a modest variation in sweep amplitude across the keyboard:</p>
<table class="p0">
  <tr>
    <td width="5%"/>
    <td>
      {sweep-ampl-mod-graph-pitch.png width=700}
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>

<h3>Envelope modulation</h3>
<p>Any of the envelope generators can control the sweep amplitude, if you need
  something fancier than the sweeps' own delay envelopes. The following
  graphs show the resulting waveshape (with time on the X-axis), for a typical
  envelope; obviously the actual shape depends on how you program the envelope.
  It is shown for a non-touch-sensitive envelope, with a 0 to 1 unit range, but
  can be used with touch-sensitive ones as well, producing up to twice the
  sweep amplitude. Such envelopes aren't very appropriate with large
  negative depths, though:</p>
<table class="p0">
  <tr>
    <td width="5%"/>
    <td>
      {sweep-ampl-mod-graph-envelope.png width=700}
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>

<h3>Delay modulation</h3>
<p>When the sweep's own internal delay generator is used, you get the
  following responses (with time on the X-axis). Note that lowering the
  positive depth makes it start earlier. Higher negative depths aren't
  particularly useful:</p>
<table class="p0">
  <tr>
    <td width="5%"/>

      {sweep-ampl-mod-graph-delay.png width=700}
