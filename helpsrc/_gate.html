<p><em>gate:</em> One of the possible functions of the left {_footswitch},
under control of the Footswitch Mode {_parameter}. When this function is used,
the keys only play when the footswitch is held (the "gate" setting)
or released (the "\-gate" setting). If the main sound and the
{_link_program link} sound have opposite settings, then the footswitch steers notes
to one or the other.</p>
