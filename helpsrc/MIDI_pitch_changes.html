<h1>MIDI pitch changes</h1>
<p>In normal MIDI, Note On and Note Off are supposed to be balanced. The
  Digital Chroma uses duplicate Note On messages preceded by Pitch LSB/MSB to
  change the pitch of a note without retriggering its envelopes.</p>
<p>Pitch LSB/MSB can also be used before a Note Off message, to change the
  pitch of the note as it is turned off, or before duplicate Note Off messages
  to change the pitch while it is dying out or held by the sustain footswitch.
  In these cases, the default pitch is its current pitch, not the pitch based
  on the note number.</p>
