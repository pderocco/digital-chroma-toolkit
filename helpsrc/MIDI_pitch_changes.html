<h1>MIDI pitch changes</h1>
<p>To change the pitch of a note while it is sounding, use Pitch MSB/LSB
  prefixes followed by this Digital Chroma-specific control:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="5%"/>
    <td width="10%">CC111</td>
    <td>Note Change</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
<p>The value of this control is a note number, and it modifies the pitch of the
  specified note. The default pitch MSB and LSB in this case are their current
  values, unrelated to the note number. This naturally works on notes that are
  released, if they are still sounding.</p>
