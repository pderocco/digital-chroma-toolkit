<h1>Initial calibrations</h1>
<p>The Digital Chroma has a number of calibrations that are done before you
  receive the kit, but there are two you will have to do yourself. If
  you're not in the U.S. Pacific time zone, you'll need to set
  the correct timezone, so that the clock will display the right time. And if
  you have one or two variable pedals, you'll need to calibrate their
  ranges, since all pedals are different.<p>
<p>For details on calibrations, go {Calibrations here}. The pedals use
  calibrations 27 and 28, and the timezone is set using calibration 36.</p>
