<p><em>popup:</em> In the Toolkit, a rectangular window that appears in the
middle of the screen when certain {_button buttons} are {_tap tapped},
containing a larger number of {_control controls}. While active, the
surrounding screen is dimmed to indicate that it is temporarily inaccessible.
When done with the popup, it is dismissed by tapping in the dimmed area, or on
the title of popup itself.</p>
<p>{_cluster Cluster} popups are slightly different in that they can be
{_drag dragged} by its title from the center of the screen and left somewhere,
which cancels the dimming of the background and makes it possible to access the
popup controls at the same time as the controls on the main screen. It is even
possible to have multiple cluster popups open at the same time. They are
dismissed by tapping their titles.</p>
