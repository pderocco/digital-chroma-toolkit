<h1><i>ENVELOPE</i> sections</h1>
<p>{envelope1-section.png width=520}</p>
<p>An "{_envelope envelope}" generator creates a time-varying
  signal that is usually triggered at the start of a note, and that returns to
  zero when the note is released. Volume is always controlled by at least one
  envelope, but they are useful for modulating other things as well.</p>
<p>The basic shape of an envelope in the Digital Chroma is called
  "ADR", for Attack Decay Release. That is, each envelope goes
  through an attack phase, rising to a variable peak level that may depend upon
  key {_velocity}, and then a decay phase in which it falls toward zero, and
  finally a release phase in which it falls toward zero at a faster rate when
  the key is released.</p>
<p>More complex shapes are created by using more than one envelope, which is
  why the Digital Chroma has four of them. For instance, if the decay for one
  is set short, and the other is set to infinity, they can be combined into the
  common "ADSR" (Attack Decay Sustain Release) shape. Or if the
  decay for one is set short, and the attack of another is set long, they can
  be combined into a "sforzando" shape which consists of an initial
  short burst which then gradually fades back in. Also, each envelope has an
  adjustable response to key velocity (or to {_pedal} or {_lever} position), so
  the user can decide how velocity should affect the two parts of a composite
  envelope independently.</p>
<p>Finally, <i>ENVELOPE 2A</i> and <i>2B</i> also have Trigger
  {_parameter parameters}, which allows the onset to be delayed by any amount,
  or triggered by various things including either {_sweep} generator, the
  release of the note, or when <i>ENVELOPE 1A</i> or <i>1B</i> enters its Decay
  phase.</p>
<p>The <i>ENVELOPE 1</i> section has:</p>
<ul>
  <li>One {Envelope_peak_cluster peak} {_cluster}. The {_button} shows the
    <i>mod select</i> parameter, which translates key velocity (or other
    controls) into peak level, and the slider shows the <i>mod depth</i>, which
    is how much the peak amplitude varies.</li>
  <li>One {Envelope_attack_cluster attack} cluster. The slider controls the
    basic attack time, but secondary parameters allow this to be
    modulated.</li>
  <li>One {Envelope_decay_cluster decay} cluster. The slider controls the basic
    decay time, but secondary parameters allow this to be modulated.</li>
  <li>One {Envelope_release_cluster release} cluster. The slider controls the
    basic release time, but a secondary parameter allows this to be
    modulated.</li>
  </ul>
<p>The <i>ENVELOPE 2</i> section also has:</p>
<ul>
  <li>One {Envelope_trigger_cluster trigger} cluster at the beginning. As
    mentioned, it allows the start of the envelope to be delayed, or triggered
    by a sweep or other things.</li>
  </ul>
