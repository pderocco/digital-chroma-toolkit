<h1>COMMON link transpose</h1>
<p>This allows the notes going into the {_link_program link} {_instrument} to
  be transposed up or down one octave. It is only meaningful if there is a
  {_link_program link} in effect. It also affects notes that go out over
  MIDI.</p>

<h2>Toolkit</h2>
<p>This is represented by three {_button buttons} in the {Common_section},
  which are mutually exclusive.</p>

<h2>Chroma panel</h2>
<p>This is set by pressing either of:</p>
<table class="p0">
  <tr>
    <td width="10%"/>
    <td>{sw-link-down-1-oct.png height=48}
      {sw-link-up-1-oct.png height=48}</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
<p>Pressing one that is off turns it on and the other one off. Pressing the one
  that is on turns it off.</p>

<h2>MIDI</h2>
<p>This is accessed via {_NRPN} 0,8. Since it is a {_bipolar} parameter, the
  values are offset by 64.</p>

<h2>Values</h2>
