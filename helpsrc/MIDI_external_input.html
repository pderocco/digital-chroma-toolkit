<h1>MIDI external input</h1>
<p>The serial MIDI port and the {_USB_host_port USB host ports} can be used to
  accept input from external keyboards or controllers. This is done by setting
  the {_global_parameter global} MIDI Main Input parameter to the desired port
  and channel number. Any external inputs (notes and controls) are merged in
  with the local source, although the Digital Chroma makes no effort to merge
  mono controls intelligently, so one should avoid using the same controls
  internally and externally. This feature allows an external keyboard or
  alternative controllers to be used in place of the internal ones. Program
  Select is supported, but none of the {_NRPN} operations are. The proprietary
  {MIDI_polyphonic_controls Note Select} and
  {MIDI_pitch_controls Pitch MSB/LSB} controls are supported.</p>
<p>The global MIDI Link Input parameter has a similar function, but routes one
  channel of external input to the link {_player} when the
  {Common_link_mode} is set to <i>link external</i>, and ensures that
  the local source data only goes to the main player. Or if it is set to
  <i>link internal</i>, the MIDI input is sent to the main player while the
  local source data is sent to the link player. This allows a second keyboard
  or pedalboard to be used along with the internal one. Program Select is not
  supported in <i>link external</i> mode, since the Link program is determined
  by the link parameters in the Main program. If MIDI Main Input and MIDI Link
  Input are the same, the latter takes precedence when <i>link external</i> or
  <i>link internal</i> is in effect.</p>
<p>MPE (MIDI Polyphonic Expression) is supported on these ports as well. When
  this mode is selected by the external device, all the channels in the lower
  zone are treated as Mono Mode channels, and combined into channel 1 inside
  the Digital Chroma, since it has the ability to represent polyphonic
  controls without resorting to multiple channels. Similarly, all channels in
  the upper zone are combined into channel 16. The
  {MIDI_Portamento_Controller Portamento Controller} or
  {MIDI_polyphonic_controls Note Select} aren't supported on input
  channels that are part of an MPE zone.</p>
