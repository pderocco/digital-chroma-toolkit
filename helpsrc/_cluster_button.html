<p><em>cluster button:</em> In the Toolkit, a {_button} that represents a
{_cluster}, and that displays its {_popup} when {_tap tapped}. Some cluster
buttons contain an italicized label, others show the value of the most
important {_selector_parameter} in the cluster. Cluster buttons can be
{_drag dragged} onto other cluster buttons that have the same set of 
{_parameter parameters} to copy them, or {_long-drag long-dragged} to swap
them. They can be dragged onto their A/B twin to {_gang} them together.</p>
