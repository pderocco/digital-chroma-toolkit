<h1>MIDI Program Change</h1>
<p>While this isn't an {_NRPN}, it is describe among the other NRPN messages
  because it is logically part of the same structure of program manipulation
  commands and responses. It causes the loading of a {_program} from a file
  into a {_player}, or reports such loading.</p>
<p><i>Editor input:</i> This loads a program into the Main player, just like
  selecting a program from the panel, and creates a new virtual {_instrument}.
  The link parameters can also set up a link, generating additional messages
  into the Link player. The program number and bank from which the program is
  loaded become attributes of the program, and are shown in the 3-digit
  display. If the file exists, the timestamp is read from the file, which
  causes the bottom two bits of the {MIDI_program_attributes Program Flags}
  attribute to be set to Unmodified. If the file doesn't exist, there is no
  timestamp, so the flags are set to Scratch. In either case, this sends a
  {MIDI_Program_Set} message back to the editor, containing the contents of the
  program.</p>
<p><i>Editor output:</i> This is never sent. {MIDI_Program_Set} is sent
  instead, because an external editor always needs to know the contents of the
  current program.</p>
<p><i>Record output:</i> This is sent whenever it is received by the Main or
  Link player, whatever the source. It is also used in lieu of Program Load No
  Link, since link parameters are meaningless in Playback input.</p>
<p><i>Playback input:</i> This loads a program into a playback player.
  Parameters having to do with links are ignored.</p>
<p><i>Main external input:</i> Same as <i>Editor input</i>.</p>
<p><i>Link external input:</i> Not supported, because the Link program is
  always selected by the link parameters in the Main program.</p>
