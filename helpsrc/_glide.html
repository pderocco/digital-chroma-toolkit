<p><em>glide:</em> A {_control_signal} generator that takes the note pitches
and turns them into smoothly sliding pitches (portamento) or rapid chromatic
scales (glissando). Note that the A {_channel} glide generator always controls
the A oscillator, and the B glide always controls the B oscillator, so if both
are to glide together, the two glide generators must have the same {_parameter}
settings.</p>
<p><i>Also:</i> {_sweep}, {_envelope}</p>
