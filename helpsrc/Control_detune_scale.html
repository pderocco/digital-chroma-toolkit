<h1>CONTROL detune scale</h1>
<p>This selects one of three scalings for the {_oscillator oscillator's}
  {Control_detune} parameter.</p>
<table class="vt">
  <tr>
    <td width="5%"/>
    <td width="10%">full</td>
    <td>The detuning is a constant number of cents at all pitches. This is
      particularly useful for nulling a beat frequency when one of the
      "ring mod" or "multiple" {_patch patches} is
      used. For most purposes, though, the result is too fast a beating at the
      top of the keyboard, too slow at the bottom.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td>half</td>
    <td>(default) The detuning is a compromise between "full" and
      "fixed". The beat frequency doubles with every two octaves
      pitch rise, for a more pleasing range across the keyboard.</p>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td>fixed</td>
    <td>The detuning is a fixed number of Hertz at all pitches. For most
      purposes, the result is too slow a beating at the top of the keyboard,
      too fast at the bottom.</td>
