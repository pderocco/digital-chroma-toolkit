<h1>MIDI RPNs</h1>
<p>An RPN is a MIDI Registered Parameter Number, which is encoded as a series
  of Control Changes, and refers to some parameter officially defined in the
  MIDI specification. The sequence is as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>CC101 with the MSB of the RPN, CC100 with the LSB of the RPN, in either
    order.</li>
  <li>CC6 with the Data value MSB.</li>
  <li>Optional CC38 with the Data value LSB.</li>
  </ul>
<p>There are only two RPNs supported by the Digital Chroma for input, and only
  on the USB host and serial MIDI input ports. Neither use the Data LSB:</p>
<table class="vt">
  <tr>
    <td width="5%"/>
    <td width="10%">RPN 0,0</td>
    <td>Pitch Bend Range in semitones. The total range is plus or minus this
      amount. This has nothing to do with lever 2, which is normally used
      internally for pitch bend.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td>RPN 0,6</td>
    <td>MIDI Polyphonic Expression (MPE). This is only recognized on channel 1
      or 16. The Data MSB specifies the number of channels above 1, or below
      16, that are to be used as member channels in the same zone as the master
      channel 1 or 16. 0 turns off MPE for the zone. The channel count can be
      as high as 15 if only one zone is used; otherwise, the sum of the two
      counts is limited to 14.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
<p>When MIDI Polyphonic Expression is used, the data are coalesced into
channels 1 or 16, using the Digital Chroma's internal encoding for
polyphonic controls. See {MIDI_polyphonic_controls} and {MIDI_pitch_controls}
for how things are re-encoded as MIDI if they are output to an external
sequencer for recording and playback.</p>
