<p><em>panel mode:</em> In the Digital Chroma, the basic mode that the control
panel is in, which determines what the numbered switches do. The mode normally
used while playing is {_program_select_mode PROG SELECT} mode, in which the
numbers select {_program programs}. While editing, the panel is in
{_parameter_select_mode PARAM SELECT} mode, in which the numbers select
{_parameter parameters} and connect them to the
{_parameter_control PARAMETER CONTROL}. The COPY FROM A and COPY FROM B modes
allow parameter values to be copied from another program, or between the A and
B parameters.</p>
<p>The panel mode has no bearing on the Toolkit.</p>
