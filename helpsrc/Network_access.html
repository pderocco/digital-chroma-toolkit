<h1>Network access</h1>
<p>The Digital Chroma makes a certain part of its internal file system
  accessible over the Ethernet interface using the SMB networking protocol
  (which is what Windows uses natively, MacOS understands, and which Linux
  accesses via a Samba client). The machine name is "Chroma#",
  where # is a digit in the range 1 through 9 set by the {Chroma_number}
  calibration setting, to allow for multiple Digital Chromas on the same
  network. The share name is simply "chroma". (These names may be
  displayed by the computer in upper case.) So, in Windows, assuming the
  default setting of 1, one could open the folder
  "\\\\CHROMA1\\CHROMA" and see the nine program subdirectories and
  various other files.</p>
<p>When this is first opened, it asks for a username and password. The username
  can be anything, and the default password is "1234567890", but
  the latter can be changed via the {Chroma_password} setting.</p>
