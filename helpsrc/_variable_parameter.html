<p><em>variable parameter:</em> A {_parameter} that represents a continuous
range of values with a certain finite resolution, such as a modulation depth.
In the Toolkit, it is represented as a {_slider}. On the Digital Chroma's
control panel, it is treated like any other parameter, but the panel {_tapper}
never taps the panel in response to change, the way it can for selector
parameters.</p>
<p><i>Also:</i> {_selector_parameter}</p>
