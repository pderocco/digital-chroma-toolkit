<h1>Timezone setting</h1>
<p>The Digital Chroma's clock keeps Universal Time, but displays local
  time, which means that the timezone must be set. This is a two step process.
  Calibration 36 first displays the current weekday, hour, and minute, and the
  {_parameter_control} allows you to set the time to match the current local
  time. Western hemisphere times are in the lower part of the range, eastern
  hemisphere in the upper part.</p>
<p>But it is common for multiple timezones to have the same time but different
  daylight saving rules, so pressing 36 again connects the parameter control to
  a list of the zones that have the same current time, each expressed as the
  name of a region or major city in the zone. Choose the one that provides the
  daylight saving rule appropriate to your location. As shipped, the timezone
  is set to "America: Los Angeles". If you press 36 again, it will
  go back to the time.</p>
