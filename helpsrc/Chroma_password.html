<h1>Chroma password</h1>
<p>When you connect the Digital Chroma to a network, and attempt to access the
  "Chroma1" device from another computer, it will show a single
  folder called "chroma" (these names may be displayed in upper
  case) but when you try to open this folder, a login prompt will appear. You
  may use any username you like\mthe Chroma ignores it\mbut you must
  also enter the proper password before access is allowed.</p>
<p>Passwords are always 10-digit numbers, and the built-in default password is
  "1234567890". If you want to change this password, select
  calibration 42. The display shows ten hyphens, which are replaced as you
  enter a new ten-digit number using switches 1 through 10 (where 10 means
  zero). The password isn't actually changed until you exit the
  calibration mode with STORE; if you don't enter the full ten digits,
  the password won't be changed.</p>
<p>Note that the Chroma won't show you the current password, but if you
  forget it, you can just invent a new one; it isn't necessary to know
  the existing password in order to change it. It is assumed that you have
  control over your own instrument; the password is only to provide some
  protection if you plug into a network that has other users on it.</p>
