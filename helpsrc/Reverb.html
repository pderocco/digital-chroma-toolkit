<h1>Reverb</h1>
<p>Each virtual {_instrument} has a Reverb Room performance control that
  selects which reverb room its output will be sent to, and a Reverb Send
  control that adjusts the mix between the dry and reverb sound.
  {_global_parameter Global parameters} of those same names may be used to
  adjust those controls for the Main and Link sounds, and to preset them
  whenever the unit is turned on. If a sequence is recorded from the Digital
  Chroma and then played back, the reverb controls in the sequence are
  independent of the Main and Link controls.</p>
<p>Sometimes, though, you want a particular sound to have a certain amount of
  reverb regardless of the what the performance controls are set to. The
  Digital Chroma provides {_program} {_parameter parameters}, also called
  Reverb Room and Reverb Send, but the Reverb Room parameter has a default
  "performance" setting that allows the normal performance controls
  to take effect. The other four settings override both reverb performance
  controls.</p>
