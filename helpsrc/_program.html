<p><em>program:</em> A complete set of {_parameter parameters} that defines a
sound. The Digital Chroma stores nine banks of fifty programs in internal
files. A program is selected for playing on the Digital Chroma's control
panel by using the numbered switches in {_program_select_mode PROG SELECT}
mode, and in the Toolkit by using the Programs screen. If a file doesn't
exist, selecting it loads a {_scratch_program}, in which all parameters have
their default values.</p>
<p>Programs also contains some metadata, including a timestamp that is set to
the present whenever a program is modified, an optional name, and an optional
description. The Toolkit provides tools for setting the name and
description.</p>
