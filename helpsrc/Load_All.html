<h1>Load All</h1>
<p>Pressing LOAD ALL loads all nine banks of {_program programs} from the
  external drive. It begins with a prompt that shows the total number of new,
  changed and deleted files in all nine banks. Press STORE to load them, or SET
  SPLIT to abort the operation.</p>
<p>Pressing SET SPLIT, LOAD ALL loads one bank at a time, showing the number of
  new, changed and deleted files in each bank. The user must press STORE up to
  nine times to load all the files, or may use SET SPLIT to skip banks. (PARAM
  SELECT or PROG SELECT can also completely abort the operation.) The final
  result display shows the totals for all copied banks.</p>
<p>One can also load from a different Chroma number folder, by holding LOAD ALL
  and pressing 1 to 9.</p>
