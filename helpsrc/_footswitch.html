<p><em>footswitch:</em> An on/off control operated by the foot. The Digital
Chroma has a dual footswitch assembly in which the right footswitch is for
sustain, and the left footswitch can be used as a latch (similar to sostenuto),
or a gate, or a {_glide} enable. It also has a separate {_sequence_program}
footswitch, which selects whatever {_program} is specified by the Sequence
Program {_parameter} in the current program.</p>
<p>The Digital Chroma calls these controls "footswitches" since the
term "pedal" is reserved for the variable {_pedal pedals} used for
volume and expression.</p>
