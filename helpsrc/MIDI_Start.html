<h1>MIDI Start</h1>
<p>MIDI defines the byte 250 as a Start byte. If the MIDI Record Output
  parameter is nonzero, and the Digital Chroma receives this on the virtual
  jack selected by that parameter, it sends the current state of the Main
  program and controls to the selected channel. If a link is in effect, it does
  the same for the Link program on the next higher channel. This allows an
  external sequencer to capture this data at the start of a recording. This
  data (for each channel) begins with a Bank MSB and a Program Change if the
  program wasn't modified, or a Bank MSB, a Sysex containing the program
  data, and a Program Set NRPN if the program was modified. In either case, it
  transmits the state of all controls except polyphonic pressure.</p>
