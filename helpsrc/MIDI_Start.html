<h1>MIDI Start</h1>
<p>MIDI defines the byte 250 as a Start byte. If the {_global_parameter global}
  {Global_midi_record_state} parameter is on, and the Digital Chroma receives
  this on the virtual jack selected by the global {Global_midi_record_out}
  parameter, it sends the current state of the Main program and controls to the
  selected channel. If a link is in effect, it does the same for the Link
  program on the next higher channel. This allows an external sequencer to
  capture this data at the start of a recording.</p>
<p>This data (for each channel) begins with a Bank MSB and a Program Change if
  the program wasn't modified, or a {_Sysex} containing the program data, a
  Bank MSB, and a {MIDI_Program_Set Program Set} {_NRPN} if the program was
  modified (or if the {Global_midi_record_program MIDI Record Program}
  parameter is turned on). It then transmits an
  {MIDI_mode_controls All Controllers Off} message, followed by the value of
  all controls (except pressure) that differ from their default values.</p>
