<h1>Waveshaper controls</h1>
<p>Like the original Chroma, the Digital Chroma separates the controls over
  pitch and wave shape into separate modules, the {_oscillator} and
  {_waveshaper}. The original Chroma's waveshaper had four wave shapes,
  saws, pulse, white noise and pink noise. The Digital Chroma has these, as
  well as various simple FM wave shapes, and an impulse wave shape.</p>
<p>The saws and pulse function sound exactly like the original Chroma. The
  white noise and pink noise also sound the same, but with one important
  difference: each voice has its own noise generator, so playing two noise
  "notes" results in a natural 3db increase in volume instead of
  the annoying 6db increase in volume in the original Chroma. Also, the noise
  is cleaner and smoother.</p>
<p>The FM wave shapes are single-operator sounds, with a single modulator and
  a single carrier. Technically, they use phase modulation, not frequency
  modulation, but FM is what such sounds are usually called. For most settings,
  both the modulator and carrier frequencies are small integer multiples of the
  nominal pitch of the oscillator, and the modulation index is controlled by
  the Width, which of course can be modulated by various control signals. Two
  settings, however, use a sine wave carrier frequency but then modulate it
  with the oscillator or low-pass filter output of the opposite channel in the
  voice. This allows more dissonant or complex forms of FM to be generated.</p>
<p>Finally, there is an impulse shape. This is a single impulse, whose duration
  is proportional to the period of the oscillator, making a click sound. This
  is primarily useful when fed into a filter whose resonance is set extremely
  high, as the filter will ring at a pitch determined by its tuning.</p>
<p>While the original Chroma only had one width modulation input, in the
  Digital Chroma the extended parameters behind Mod Select and Mod Depth are
  used for a second modulation input, whose parameters are called Mod 2 Select
  and Mod 2 Depth. This is particularly useful because it allows the width to
  be modulated in a conventional manner with a sweep or envelope, and then also
  be modulated by a glide to voice it across the keyboard.</p>
