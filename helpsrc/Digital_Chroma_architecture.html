<h1>Digital Chroma architecture</h1>
<p>To program the Digital Chroma, you should have a basic grasp of subtractive 
  synthesis. The Chroma, like all subtractive synthesizers, works by generating
  raw wave shapes that have loads of harmonics, and feeding them into filters
  that reduce the harmonic content. Crafting sounds involves deciding how the
  various characteristics of the sound (pitch, pulse width, filter tuning and
  volume) should vary in time, and vary with key velocity, {_lever levers},
  etc., and figuring out how to make the available tools ({_envelope}
  generators, {_sweep} generators, etc.) make those shapes.</p>
<p>This section will assume you basically "get" subtractive
  synthesis, but are unfamiliar with the Chroma. Perhaps you bought a used
  Chroma simply to install the Digital Chroma Upgrade Kit, because you liked
  the sound of it. Or perhaps you're just reading this documentation to
  get an idea of what the Digital Chroma is capable of doing, to decide whether
  you're interested.</p>
