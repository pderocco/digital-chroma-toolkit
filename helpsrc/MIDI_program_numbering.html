<h1>MIDI program numbering</h1>
<p>The Digital Chroma contains nine banks of 50 {_program programs}. Over MIDI,
  the bank is specified by the Bank MSB (CC0), and the Bank LSB (CC32) is
  ignored. It uses zero-based numbering, so the valid bank number range is 0 to
  8 and the valid program number range is 0 to 49. On MIDI input, the Bank
  value persists, so isn't needed before every Program Change or
  program-related {_NRPN}, but on MIDI output, every program message (Program
  Change or NRPN) is preceded by a Bank MSB.</p>
<p>Selecting a Bank MSB outside the 0 to 8 range causes any subsequent message
  that uses the bank number to be ignored completely. The same is true of any
  message that contains a program number outside the 0 to 49 range. Such
  ignored messages are filtered out, and don't even generate a response
  or echo to an external editor or sequence recorder.</p>
<p>The only time one-based numbering is used for programs and banks over MIDI
  is in the values of parameters or attributes that refer to programs, because
  these values are seen by the user, and zero is often a valid value with a
  special meaning (e.g., current bank, previous program).</p>
