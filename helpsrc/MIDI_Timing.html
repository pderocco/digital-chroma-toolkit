<h1>MIDI Timing</h1>
<p>MIDI defines the byte 248 as a Timing byte, and uses it to synchronize
  devices that keep time. If the Digital Chroma receives this on any MIDI
  input port, it is used to advance the phase of a timer that the sweep
  generators in a Chroma program can synchronize to. This can also control the
  arpeggiation rate. If these bytes stop, the internal timer continues to run
  at its last rate. If this feature is used while recording a sequence, and the
  synchronized sweep is used, rather than just arpeggiation, it is important
  that the Timing bytes also be delivered to the Digital Chroma during
  playback, to ensure that the sweeps run at the same speed.</p>
