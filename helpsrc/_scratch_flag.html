<p><em>scratch flag:</em> In the Digital Chroma's PROGRAM NUMBER display,
an indicator that says "SCRATCH" when the {_current_program}
doesn't exist. In the Toolkit, this is indicated by the
{_Program_Info_button} showing the program number and name in yellow instead of
light blue. All {_parameter parameters} have their default values. As soon as
the sound is edited, a real program is created, and the {_modified_flag}
appears instead.</p>
<p><i>Also:</i> {_modified_flag}</p>
