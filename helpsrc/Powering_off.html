<h1>Powering off</h1>
<p>Since the Digital Chroma is a computer, it's not generally a good idea
  to turn it off by yanking the power. This can, in rare cases, lead to
  corruption of the files that store your {_program programs}. Instead, press
  the power switch firmly for a second. The display will say "Shutting
  down\.", and the instrument will turn off after a second or so. Then,
  it is safe to unplug the unit if you need to pack it up and move it.</p>
<p>If the unit ever crashes (not that that is likely to happen), you can force
  the power to shut off by holding the power switch for five seconds. Then,
  after waiting a few seconds, you can press the power switch again to restart
  the instrument.</p>
