<p><em>instrument:</em> A software process in the Digital Chroma that is
capable of playing sounds controlled by a single {_program}. Every {_voice}
belongs to the instrument that played it. When a new program is selected, a new
instrument is created, so notes still sounding from the previous program are
not affected.</p>
<p>While a voice does the sound generation for a single note, instruments do
common processing, including tone control, distortion, and mono {_sweep} and
{_envelope} generation.</p>
