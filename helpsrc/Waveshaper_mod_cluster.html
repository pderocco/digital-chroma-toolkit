<p>This contains a standard {Waveshaper_mod_select <i>mod select</i>}
  {_parameter} and a corresponding {Waveshaper_mod_depth <i>mod depth</i>}
  {_slider}. Note that the depth on the slider is shown in cycles for the
  various FM {Waveshaper_shape shapes}, and in percent for the saws and pulse
  shapes. These have no effect if the shape is set to pink noise, white noise,
  or impulse.</p>
