<h1>MIDI Clock Set</h1>
<p>NRPN 48,0 sets or reports the current UTC time in the preceding
  {MIDI_time_sysex}.</p>
<p><i>Editor input:</i> If the time in the preceding Time sysex is valid, this
  sets the Digital Chroma's clock. The Data MSB value is ignored, but must
  still be set to trigger the operation. If the Digital Chroma is connected to
  the Internet, though, any change will be overridden by the correct time as
  read from an Internet time server. Nothing is sent back to the editor.</p>
<p><i>Editor output:</i> This reports the current time in the Digital
  Chroma's clock in response to {MIDI_Clock_Get} NRPN 112,0. The data
  value is 1 if the clock is synchronized to the Internet, 0 if it is
  free-running.</p>
<p><i>Record output, Playback input, External input:</i> Not supported.</p>
