<h1>Velocity calibration</h1>
<p>If certain keys feel different from the rest, their velocity sensitivity can
  be tweaked by selecting calibration 31. Pressing a key shows its key name in
  the display, along with its current calibration value, which has a \+10
  range. Move the {_parameter_control} up to increase the velocity sensitivity,
  or down to decrease it, until it feels similar to the other keys. Any keys
  not actually adjusted with the slider retain their previous calibrations.</p>
<p>If you make a mess of the velocity calibrations, you can reset all keys to
  zero by selecting calibration 32. The display says "Press again to
  reset", so press 32 a second time. These changes are still not
  permanent until you exit calibration mode by pressing STORE, though.</p>
