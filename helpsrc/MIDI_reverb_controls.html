<h1>MIDI reverb controls</h1>
<p>The Reverb Room control divides the 0 to 127 range into quarters, since
  there are four rooms. On output, it always transmits values 0, 32, 64 or 96.
  The Reverb Send control uses an x<sup>2</sup> transfer function, and also
  turns down the dry sound up to 12db when raised past 96. For the Main and
  Link instruments, these controls come from global parameters, and are sent
  on startup or whenever those parameters are changed. But since they're
  controls and not program parameters, they can be recorded as part of a
  sequence, and each separately recorded channel can have different reverb
  control values.</p>
<p class="extra">A {_program} that needs specific reverb settings can override
  the performance controls, in which case the latter are ignored. This is done
  with the {Control_reverb_room} and
  {Control_reverb_send} program parameters.</p>
