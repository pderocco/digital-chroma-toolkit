<h1>FILTER tune cluster</h1>
<p>{filter-tune-cluster.png width=373}</p>
<p>This contains the {Filter_mode <i>mode</i>} parameter which determines
  whether the {_filter} passes frequencies up to the tuning frequency
  (lowpass), frequencies around the tuning frequency (bandpass), or frequencies
  from the tuning frequency up (highpass). It also determines whether it is a
  two-pole (2p) filter or four-pole (4p); the latter attenuates out-of-band
  frequencies twice as much.</p>
<p>This also contains the {Filter_tune <i>tune</i>} {_slider}, which shows
  the basic filter tuning before modulation as a MIDI pitch (although it
  exceeds the MIDI range at the high end). This is the pitch that will be heard
  if the {_resonance} is turned all the way up so that the filter
  oscillates.</p>
