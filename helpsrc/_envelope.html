<p><em>envelope:</em> A {_control_signal} generator that generates a signal
that is usually triggered at the start of a note, rises to a peak value that
may vary with {_velocity} or other things, then optionally decay toward zero,
and finally decay toward zero when the note is released. Each {_voice} has two
basic envelopes, plus two more that can also be delayed or repetitively
triggered by {_sweep} generators or other things. These latter two can also be
computed by the virtual {_instrument}, for envelopes that are common to all
{_voice voices}, for effects like simulating Hammond organ percussion.</p>
<p><i>Also:</i> {_glide}, {_sweep}</p>
