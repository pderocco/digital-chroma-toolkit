<h1>ENVELOPE trigger cluster</h1>
<p>{envelope-trigger-cluster.png width=373}</p>
<p>This cluster, which only envelopes 2A and 2B have. contains a single
  {_slider} for the {Envelope_trigger <i>trigger</i>} parameter, which sets the
  amount of delay before the envelope starts. The highest twelve settings
  instead cause the envelope to be triggered by things other than the initial
  key press, and two of the settings cause the envelope to be generated by the
  virtual {_instrument} so that all voices will share the same envelope. The
  {_button buttons} below the slider allow these selections to be made
  quickly.</p>
