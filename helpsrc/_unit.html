<p><em>unit:</em> A quantity that represents the scaling of a {_control_signal}
value. For note pitch and {_glide} output, one unit equals 32 semitones, so the
Digital Chroma's keyboard is two units long. {_sweep Sweep} signals
always have a +1 unit maximum values, but some shapes are {_unipolar} while
others are {_bipolar}. {_envelope Envelopes} go from zero to one if fixed
amplitude, or up to two if modulated by velocity or pedal. {_lever Levers} are
\+1 unit, or 0 to 1 unit if only one side of the lever is used.
{_pedal Pedals} are 0 to 1 unit. Finally, modulation depths are documented in
terms of how much they vary what they modulate for each unit of input.</p>
