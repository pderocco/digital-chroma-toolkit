<h1>MIDI record output</h1>
<p>The {_USB_device_port}, which contains four virtual jacks, can be used to
  send the Main and Link messages to a computer for recording. This is done by
  setting the {_global_parameter global} MIDI Record Output parameter to the
  desired jack and channel number for the Main output, and the Link
  automatically uses the next higher channel on the same jack.</p>
<p>If you use something other than the normal polyphonic
  {Common_keyboard_algorithm}, the recorded messages will
  use the proprietary Digital Chroma {MIDI_pitch_controls}. If you use the
  {MIDI_external_input} in MPE mode, the recorded messages will also use the
  proprietary {MIDI_polyphonic_controls}. These work correctly when played back
  via the Digital Chroma, but other software (e.g., music notation) will not
  understand them.</p>
<p>When you record a sequence and play it back later, it's important that the
  same programs be available. If you want to hear the correct sounds regardless
  of what programs are contained within the Digital Chroma when you play the
  sequence, you can turn on the global
  {Global_midi_record_program MIDI Record Program} parameter before the
  recording. This causes all Program Change messages in the record output to be
  replaced with {MIDI_program_sysex Sysex} and {MIDI_Program_Set} {_NRPN NRPNs}
  messages containing the actual program data. This increases the amount of
  data your sequencer has to store, and only works if your sequencer can record
  Sysex messages.</p>
<p>When starting a recording, it is important to record the initial state of
  the Main and Link instruments. This can be done manually from the Digital
  Chroma's control panel by pressing SET SPLIT, LINK UNISON after starting the
  recording, and before playing the first note. If you normally record entire
  tracks as a single take, and your recorder can be set up to emit a
  {MIDI_Start} byte at the start of the recording, you can configure the
  Digital Chroma to send this state automatically in response to this byte, by
  turning on the global {Global_midi_record_state MIDI Record State}
  parameter.</p>
<p>During recording, one shouldn't do anything that modifies any stored
  programs, because the NRPNs that represent these operations are not sent to
  the Record output, or recognized on the Playback input.</p>
