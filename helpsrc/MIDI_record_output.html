<h1>MIDI record output</h1>
<p>The {_USB_device_port}, which contains four virtual jacks, can be used to
  send the Main and Link messages to a computer for recording. This is done by
  setting the {_global_parameter global} MIDI Record Output parameter to the
  desired jack and channel number for the Main output, and the Link
  automatically uses the next higher channel on the same jack.</p>
<p>If you use something other than the normal polyphonic
  {Common_keyboard_algorithm}, the recorded messages will
  use the proprietary Digital Chroma {MIDI_pitch_controls}. If you use the
  {MIDI_external_input} in MPE mode, the recorded messages will also use the
  proprietary {MIDI_polyphonic_controls}. These work correctly when played back
  via the Digital Chroma, but other software (e.g., music notation) will not
  understand them.</p>
<p>If a MIDI Start byte is received on the jack used for recording, the
  Digital Chroma sends the entire state of the Main and Link instruments. This
  uses a Program Change if the Main program is unmodified, or a
  {MIDI_Program_Set} {_NRPN} containing the actual program data in a
  {MIDI_program_sysex Sysex} if it is modified, followed by all control values
  except pressure. This is useful when starting recording.</p>
<p>During recording, one shouldn't do anything that modifies any stored
  programs, because the NRPNs that represent these operations are not sent to
  the Record output, or recognized on the Playback input.</p>
