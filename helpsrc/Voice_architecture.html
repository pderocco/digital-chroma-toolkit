<h1>Voice architecture</h1>
<p>The Digital Chroma has a large number of {_voice voices}, each of which is a
  software entity capable of playing one note at a time. The resources
  contained in each voice are shown in this diagram:</p>
<p>{voice-architecture.png width=513}</p>
<p>The vertical arrows show control signals, while the horizontal arrows in the
  bottom section show audio signals. The disconnected arrows pointing into the
  various resources are modulation inputs, most of which can be connected to
  any single arrow pointing out of other resources, with an arbitrary amount
  or "depth" factor.</p>
<h2>Performance input</h2>
<p>The top row shows the inputs from the keyboard, which produce notes,
  velocities, and optionally polyphonic pressure. It also shows the inputs
  from the two built-in {_lever levers}, the two inputs for optional
  {_pedal pedals}, and the optional {_ribbon} controller.</p>
<h2>Control signal generators</h2>
<p>The middle section shows the user programmable control signals.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The {_glide GLIDE} modules are permanently driven from the
    keyboard's note pitch, and can generate smooth slides (portamento) or
    chromatic scales (glissando). The T input indicates the glide time can be
    modulated by other things.</li>
  <li>The {_sweep SWEEP} modules correspond to what are often called Low
    Frequency Oscillators, or LFOs, in other synthesizers. They generate
    repeating control signals, such as sine waves for vibrato, square waves for
    trills, or more complex patterns. The R and A inputs indicate that both the
    rate and the amplitude can be modulated by other things.
  <li>The {_envelope ENVELOPE} modules generate time-varying signals that are
    triggered at the start of each note, with a peak value that can be made
    dependent on key velocity or other things. The Chroma's envelope
    shape is ADR, meaning that each envelope has an Attack phase, a Decay
    phase, and a Release phase. More complex shapes, such as the common ADSR
    (Attack/Decay/Sustain/Release) shape are obtained by mixing two ADR
    envelopes with different settings. The A, D, and R inputs indicate that
    these three parameters can be modulated by other things, and the P input
    indicates that the peak can be modulated. ENVELOPE 2A and 2B each have an
    additional Trigger parameter which can either delay the start of the
    envelope, or cause the envelope to be triggered by other things besides key
    presses.</li>
  </ul>
<h2>Audio processing</h2>
<p>The bottom section shows the audio modules.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The {_oscillator OSCILLATOR} modules determine the pitch of notes. Their
    basic pitch is permanently controlled by the corresponding GLIDE
    generators, but there are also five modulation inputs, for things like
    pitch bend and vibrato.</li>
  <li>The {_waveshaper WAVESHAPER} modules determine the initial harmonic
    content of notes. They can generate pulse waves with a variable width, a
    "saws" shape which combines two sawteeth with a variable phase
    delay between them, or white or pink noise. Unlike the original Chroma,
    they can also generate simple single-operator FM sounds. There are two
    modulation inputs for the pulse width, saws phase, or FM depth.</li>
  <li>The {_filter FILTER} modules modify the harmonic content of the sounds.
    Each can be configured as a 2-pole or 4-pole lowpass, bandpass, or highpass
    filter. They have continuously variable resonance (unlike the original
    Chroma's eight fixed settings), and can be made to self-oscillate by
    setting the resonance to maximum. They have five modulation inputs for the
    tuning, plus one for the resonance.</li>
  <li>The {_amplifier AMPLIFIER} modules adjust the volume of the sound, and
    have three modulation inputs for volume, plus one for output panning. The
    first two modulation inputs come from any of the four envelopes, and the
    third is for post-modulation by other sources like a pedal.</li>
  </ul>
<p>The diagram shows the default interconnection among the audio modules, as
  two independent single-oscillator {_channel channels} that are mixed at the
  output. These are often programmed to have the same sound, with slight
  detuning between them, and with the outputs panned to left and right for
  spaciousness. But the {_patch PATCH} parameter in each program allows the
  modules to be interconnected in a number of different ways, and allows for
  special effects like Sync and Ring Mod. Details of this can be found
  {Control_patch here}.</p>
