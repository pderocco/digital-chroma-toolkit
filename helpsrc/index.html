<h1>DIGITAL CHROMA TOOLKIT</h1>
<p>The Toolkit runs on a laptop or desktop computer, and controls an attached
  Digital Chroma. It provides access to the {_current_program} controlling the
  sound, all the stored programs, and the
  {_global_parameter Global Parameters}.</p>
<p>The Toolkit window contains a {Navigation_bar} on the left, which is always
  visible, and a content screen on the right. The four middle buttons in the
  Navigation bar choose what screen is visible:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b><i>PROGRAMS</i></b> displays a bank of {_program programs}, and allows
    you to select them for playing.</li>
  <li><b><i>EDITOR</i></b> displays the parameters in the current program, and
    allows them to be edited.</li>
  <li><b><i>TOOLS</i></b> provides conversion and backup, and access to the
    global parameters in the Digital Chroma.</li>
  <li><b><i>HELP</i></b> is what you're looking at now.</li>
  </ul>
<p>This Help screen provides documentation on the entire Digital Chroma
  Toolkit, and on the Digital Chroma itself. The Help browser's most important
  features are:</p>
<ul>

    your finger on a touchscreen.</li>

    to go back or forward through your browsing history.</li>

    context-sensitive help.</li>
  <li>{_long-press Long-press} the <em>HELP</em> button to get back to this

  </ul>
