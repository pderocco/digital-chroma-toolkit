<p><em>sweep:</em> A {_control_signal} generator that generates a repetitive
signal, usually called a "low frequency oscillator" or
"LFO" in other instruments. Each {_voice} has two of them, and they
can be used to modulate anything, although they are most commonly used for
vibrato. Both the rate and amplitude of the sweep can be modulated by other
things, such as {_lever levers} or {_envelope envelope}.</p>
<p>Sweeps can be synchronized to key presses. They can also be computed by the
virtual {_instrument} instead of by each {_voice}, so that they are synchronous
for all notes. Their rate can also be locked to received MIDI clocks.</p>
<p><i>Also:</i> {_glide}, {_envelope}</p>
