<h1>SWEEP amplitude cluster</h1>
<p>{sweep-amplitude-cluster.png width=373}</p>
<p>This contains {_parameter parameters} related to the {_sweep} shape and
  amplitude. The {Sweep_shape <i>shape</i>} parameter has sixteen choices,
  including some short repetitive patterns. The box to the right of the
  {_button buttons} shows a graph of four sweep cycles, which is the length of
  the longest pattern.<p>
<p>The {Sweep_amplitude_mod_select <i>mod select</i>} parameter chooses what
  controls the amplitude of the sweep. Since delayed sweep is so commonly used,
  it includes a built-in delay ramp generator, so that a full {_envelope}
  doesn't need to be used. The delay ramp goes from \-1 to +1, but
  the sweep amplitude can't be negative so the result is to delay for the
  first half of the time, and then ramp from zero to one over the second
  half.</p>
<p>The {Sweep_amplitude_mod_depth <i>mod depth</i>} parameter determines how
  much the amplitude of the sweep is varied. It scales the modulation around a
  value of one {_unit}, rather than zero. That is, if the depth is turned off
  (the default), you always get the full sweep amplitude. If it is set to 100%,
  the modulation can vary the amplitude from zero to 100%. If it is set to 50%,
  it can vary the amplitude from 50% to 100%.</p>
<p>The rectangular box is actually a graph of the response, and varies when the
  two parameters are adjusted. See the <i>mod depth</i> parameter for details
  on how to interpret these graphs.</p>
