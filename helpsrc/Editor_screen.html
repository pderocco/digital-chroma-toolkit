<h1>Editor screen</h1>
<p>The <em>Editor</em> {_screen} is fairly complicated, because the Digital
  Chroma sound architecture has many more {_parameter parameters} than can
  reasonably be displayed all at once on a single screen. Instead, parameters
  are grouped into "{_cluster clusters}".</p>
<h2>Clusters</h2>
<p>Most of the {_button buttons} on the main <em>Editor</em> screen are
  "cluster buttons", and {_tap tapping} any of these buttons
  displays a {_popup} showing all the parameters in the cluster. The cluster
  button may contain a simple italicized label, like <i>tone</i>, or may show
  the (non-italicized) value of the most important {_selector_parameter} in the
  cluster. If the cluster button has a {_slider} next to it, the slider
  controls the most important {_variable_parameter} in the cluster. These
  sliders are the parameters that you will most commonly be adjusting back and
  forth when programming the Digital Chroma, which is why they are on the main
  screen.</p>
<h2>Popups</h2>
<p>When a popup is displayed, the main screen is dimmed, indicating its
  controls are temporarily inaccessible. The popup can be dismissed by tapping
  the dimmed area, or the popup's title. It is also possible to {_drag}
  a popup away from the center of the screen by its title, which removes the
  dimming from the main screen. In this state, you can manipulate the popup
  controls <i>and</i> the main screen controls; you can even open more popups
  and move them to different places on the screen. This can be useful if you
  need to tweak secondary parameters back and forth. The popups can still be
  dismissed by tapping their titles.</p>
<p class="extra">You can also dismiss all popups with the "Escape" key.</p>
<p>Within cluster popups, selector parameters are shown as arrays of buttons
  for each possible value, with the current choice highlighted. This means it
  only takes three taps to change a selector value: one to display the popup,
  one to change the value, and one to dismiss the popup.</p>
<h2>Highlighting</h2>
<p>You'll notice that some controls are white and others are gray.
  Controls are gray if they are not currently affecting the sound. For
  instance, if a modulation depth is zero, its slider and cluster button are
  both gray. As soon as the depth is set to a nonzero value, they turn white,
  unless what they are modulating isn't actually participating in the
  sound generation. For instance, if an {_envelope} isn't used anywhere
  in the program, it doesn't matter what you set its parameters to; the
  controls will always be gray.</p>
<h2>Default values</h2>
<p>Every parameter has a {_default_value}, which is the value it has in a
  "{_scratch_program scratch}" sound (the sound of a non-existent
  program). You can reset a slider to its default value by
  {_long-press long-pressing} it. You can reset a selector parameter to its
  default value by long-pressing any of its value buttons. And you can reset an
  entire cluster to its default values by long-pressing the cluster button.</p>
<p>A few sliders also have a "significant" value, which is a
  commonly used non-default value. This can be set quickly by tapping the
  slider. For instance, you can set a pulse width to 50% this way, or to 0% by
  long-pressing it. Sliders that don't have significant values ignore a
  tap.</p>
<h2>Copying clusters</h2>
<p>You can copy all the values from one cluster into another of the same type
  by dragging its cluster button and dropping it on the other cluster button.
  You can also swap two clusters of the same type by {_long-drag long-dragging}
  one onto the other. When you do this, the first cluster is initially reset to
  its default values, but the previous values are what get dragged to and
  swapped with the second cluster.</p>
<h2>Ganging clusters</h2>
  If a cluster is dragged onto its A/B twin, the parameters are not only copied
  but the two clusters are {_gang ganged} together in parallel. The B
  {_channel} controls are replaced with a wide button with an equals sign in
  it, and the A channel controls operate both in parallel. Tapping the equals
  sign ungangs the controls, allowing them to be individually adjusted
  again.</p>
<h2>Sections</h2>
<p>The screen is divided into sections. The <i>COMMON</i> section contains
  parameters that don't pertain directly to the actual sound generation,
  like the {_link_program link} parameters. The <i>CONTROL</i> section contains
  overall sound parameters. The remaining sections on the left are
  {_control_signal} generators, two in each section, and they can be freely
  assigned to any modulation inputs. The sections on the right side of the
  screen are pairs of sound generation and processing modules, which can be
  interconnected in various ways according to the {_patch} parameter. The
  sections are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>{Common_section <i>COMMON</i>}</li>
  <li>{Control_section <i>CONTROL</i>}</li>
  <li>{Glide_section <i>GLIDE A \& B</i>}</li>
  <li>{Sweep_section <i>SWEEP A \& B</i>}</li>
  <li>{Envelope_sections <i>ENVELOPE 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B</i>}</li>
  <li>{Oscillator_section <i>OSCILLATOR A \& B</i>}</li>
  <li>{Waveshaper_section <i>WAVESHAPER A \& B</i>}</li>
  <li>{Filter_section <i>FILTER A \& B</i>}</li>
  <li>{Amplifier_section <i>AMPLIFIER A \& B</i>}</li>
  </ul>
<p>You can also see the above help pages by tapping the
  {question.png height=16} button in the corners of the
  sections.</p>
<h2>Where used?</h2>
<p>In an architecture as versatile as the Digital Chroma's, one often
  wonders where some control signal generator is actually used. The
  <em>Editor</em> screen makes it easy to find out. If you tap the title of any
  of the control signal generators on the left side of the screen (i.e.,
  <i>GLIDE A</i>, <i>GLIDE B</i>, <i>SWEEP A</i>, etc.), other cluster buttons
  will turn bright red if those control signals have any effect on those
  clusters.</p>
<p>The small buttons just below the <em>Editor</em> title let you do the same
  thing for the {_performance_control} inputs.</p>
<h2>Hotkeys</h2>
<p>You can dismiss all popups with the "Escape" key.</p>
<p>You can increment and decrement a parameter (or a ganged pair) using the
  Left and Right cursor keys. These are always connected to whatever parameter
  was last modified via a button or slider in the Toolkit.</p>
