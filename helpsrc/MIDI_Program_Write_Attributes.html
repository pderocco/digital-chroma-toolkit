<h1>MIDI Program Write Attributes</h1>
<p>NRPN 21,0 on the Editor output channel reports the attributes and
  {_timestamp} of a {_program} file, in response to
  {MIDI_Program_Read_Attributes} NRPN 85,0 on the Editor input. The Bank MSB
  and the Data MSB specify the bank and program number. If the file exists, it
  is preceded by a {MIDI_timestamp_sysex}. A Data LSB contains the program
  flags attribute, but the bottom two bits are never 2 because there is no such
  thing as a "modified" file.</p>
