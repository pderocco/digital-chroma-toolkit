<h1>Load Miscellaneous</h1>
<p>Pressing SET SPLIT, LOAD ONE loads various miscellaneous files. This
  differs from loading programs in that a missing file on the external drive
  does not cause the corresponding file to be deleted from the Chroma. The
  operation is performed in stages, giving the user the opportunity to copy or
  not copy each file or group of files. The things that may be copied
  (including their file names) are:</p>
<table class="vt">
  <tr>
    <td width="5%"/>
    <td width="20%">main firmware</td>
    <td width="15%"><code>chroma</code></td>
    <td>The firmware that generates the sound. If this is copied, it will be
      executed when the Digital Chroma is restarted</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td>panel firmware</td>
    <td><code>panel.bin</code></td>
    <td>The firmware for the small microprocessor on the control panel
      responsible for scanning inputs, driving the display, and handling the
      {_USB_device_port}. If new versions of <code>chroma</code> and
      <code>panel.bin</code> are both provided, they must both be loaded before
      the Digital Chroma is restarted, or they may be unable to communicate
      with each other.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td>calibration data</td>
    <td><code>cal.ini</code></td>
    <td>The calibration data.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td>configuration file</td>
    <td><code>config.ini</code></td>
    <td>An optional configuration file that can modify some of the startup
      parameters to the main firmware.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td>global parameters</td>
    <td><code>globals.ini</code></td>
    <td>The {_global_parameter} settings.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td>reverb definitions</td>
    <td><code>rev0-3.ini</td>
    <td>These four files contain parameters that control the reverb algorithm
      for the four "rooms".</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
<p>Any file or group of files that doesn't exist on the external drive,
  or that matches the corresponding file or files in the Chroma, is skipped
  over.</p>
