<h1>Hookup</h1>
<p>In case someone else installed the Digital Chroma upgrade kit for you, and
  you're presented with the complete instrument for the first time,
  you'll need to know how to set it up.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Connect the dual {_footswitch} to the DUAL FSW jack on the rear
    panel.</li>
  <li>If you have one or two variable {_pedal pedals}, connect them to the
    PEDAL jacks.</li>
  <li>For analog audio out, connect a stereo <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub>\" plug
    to the LEFT/STEREO jack, or connect separate mono plugs to RIGHT and
    LEFT/STEREO. The LEFT/STEREO jack is also usable with headphones.</li>
  <li>If you're going to use the Digital Chroma Toolkit on a PC, Mac, or
    Linux machine, connect a standard USB cable between the USB DEVICE jack and
    the computer.</li>
  <li>Connect a power cord to the POWER jack, and plug the unit in.</li>
  </ul>
<p>Since the Digital Chroma is based on a conventional desktop PC motherboard,
  you turn it on the same way you turn on any other computer, by pressing the
  POWER pushbutton firmly for a second or so. The display will say <i>Starting
  up\.</i>, and after a short interval, it will show {_program} 101 (bank 1,
  program 1), and play normally.</p>
