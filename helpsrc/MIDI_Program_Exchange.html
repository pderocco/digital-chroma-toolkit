<h1>MIDI Program Exchange</h1>
<p>NRPN 24,0 exchanges the {_program} in the Main {_instrument} with a file, or
  reports such an exchange. The Bank MSB and the Data MSB specify the bank and
  program number.</p>
<p><i>Editor input:</i> This exchanges the program in the Main instrument, and
  sends back {MIDI_Program_Store} NRPN 23,0 and {MIDI_Program_Set} NRPN 16,0.
  If the program in the Main instrument is a scratch program, the file is
  deleted. If the file didn't exist, a scratch program is loaded into the
  instrument. The current program number and bank attributes are unchanged.<p>
<p><i>Editor output:</i> This is never sent. Program Store NRPN 23,0 and
  Program Set NRPN 16,0 are sent instead, whether the operation was caused by
  receipt of Program Exchange, or the user pressed SET SPLIT, STORE. This is
  because it is assumed the editor needs to know the complete contents of the
  current program, but doesn't know the complete contents of stored
  programs.</p>
<p><i>Record output, Playback input, External input:</i> Not supported.</p>
