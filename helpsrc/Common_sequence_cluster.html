<h1>COMMON sequence cluster</h1>
<p>{common-sequence-cluster.png width=373}</p>
<p>This displays the {Common_sequence_program} parameter, which determines
  which new program will be selected when the Sequence Program {_footswitch} is
  pressed. The <i>program</i> button can only reset it to its default value of
  "previous" by {_long-press long-pressing} it. This makes the
  footswitch revert to the previously selected program, including any unsaved
  edits. This parameter can only be set to an actual program by using the
  {Program_popup} from the Programs {_screen}.</p>
<p>Note that the program number shown before the name may be either a 1- or
  2-digit number to sequence to the program in the same bank as the current
  program, or a 3-digit number to sequence to a specific bank. The difference
  is significant if the current program is ever moved to a different bank.</p>
