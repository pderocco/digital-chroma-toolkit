<h1>COMMON link cluster</h1>
<p>{common-link-cluster.png width=373}</p>
<p>This contains all {_parameter parameters} pertaining to the {_link_program link}.
  The {Common_link_program <i>link program</i>} button shows the number and
  name of the program linked to (or that would be linked to if the <i>link
  mode</i> weren't set to "no link"). It can only be set by
  using the {Program_popup} from the Programs {_screen}, except that it can be
  reset to its {_default_value}, which is "self" by
  {_long-press long-pressing} the button. This choice causes the main and link
  to play the same sound, and for any edits to be directed to both of them.
  In "link unison" mode, this sounds similar to {_voice}
  {Control_voice_count stacking}, except that the two sounds still have
  independent {Common_main_transpose} and {Common_link_transpose}
  parameters.</p>
<p>Note that the program number shown before the name may be either a 1- or
  2-digit number to link to the program in the same bank as the current
  program, or a 3-digit number to link to a specific bank. The difference is
  significant if the current program is ever moved to a different bank.</p>
<p>The <i>{Common_link_mode}</i> buttons select which keys play the
  main sound and which play the link sound. The
  <i>{Common_keyboard_split}</i> slider sets the keyboard split
  point, which is used in the modes with "upper" or
  "lower" in their names. It is, however, easier to set the
  keyboard split from the Digital Chroma's control panel, by pressing
  {_SET_SPLIT} and then pressing the key that is to be the bottom of the upper
  portion of the keyboard.</p>
<p>The last three {_slider sliders} introduce variations into the main and
  link sounds, but only when a link is in effect. The
  <i>{Common_link_balance}</i> adusts the relative volumes, the
  <i>{Common_link_detune}</i> adjusts their relative tuning, and
  the <i>{Common_link_spread}</i> nudges or forces them toward
  opposite sides of the pan range.</p>
