<h1>COMMON main transpose</h1>
<p>This allows the notes going into the main {_instrument} to be transposed up
  or down one octave. It takes effect regardless of whether there is a
  {_link_program link} in effect. It also affects notes that go out over
  MIDI.</p>

<h2>Toolkit</h2>
<p>This is represented by three {_button buttons} in the {Common_section},
  which are mutually exclusive.</p>

<h2>Chroma panel</h2>
<p>This is set by pressing either of:</p>
<table class="p0">
  <tr>
    <td width="10%"/>
    <td>{sw-main-down-1-oct.png height=48}
      {sw-main-up-1-oct.png height=48}</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
<p>Pressing one that is off turns it on and the other one off. Pressing the one
  that is on turns it off.</p>

<h2>MIDI</h2>
<p>This is accessed via {_NRPN} 0,7. Since it is a {_bipolar} parameter, the
  values are offset by 64.</p>
