<h1>Save All</h1>
<p>Pressing SAVE ALL is the inverse of the Load All operation, saving all nine
  {_program} banks to the external drive. Pressing SET SPLIT, SAVE ALL does the
  same thing, only prompts for each folder individually. The final result
  display shows the totals for all copied banks. You can also save to a
  different Chroma number folder, by holding SAVE ALL and pressing 1 to 9.</p>
