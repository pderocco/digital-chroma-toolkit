<h1>ENVELOPE release cluster</h1>
<p>{envelope-release-cluster.png width=373}</p>
<p>This contains a {Envelope_release_time <i>time</i>} {_slider} to set the
  time it takes for the envelope to drop toward zero when the key is released.
  Since it slows down as it approaches zero, and theoretically never gets
  there, this is actually the "time constant", indicating how long
  it would have taken to get to zero if it didn't slow down.</p>
<p>This also contains a {Envelope_release_mod_select <i>mod select</i>}
  {_parameter} that can slow the release by various ratios, for
  "slow" key releases, defined as a release {_velocity} less than
  the {_global_parameter global} <i>release threshold</i> parameter. It can
  also use either {_pedal} to vary the release time from its nominal setting to
  whatever the {Envelope_decay_cluster decay} time is set to, rather like a
  variable sustain pedal.</p>
