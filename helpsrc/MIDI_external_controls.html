<h1>MIDI external controls</h1>
<p>When the {_global_parameter global} MIDI Main Input or MIDI Link Input
  parameters are used to enable External input from the serial or
  {_USB_host_port USB host} MIDI, the following interpretations hold:</p>
<ul>
  <li>All performance controls and mode controls are supported. Reverb and
    link controls are not.</li>
  <li>Bank MSB and Program Change are supported on the MIDI Main Input, using
    0-based numbers. Bank MSB must be in 0\.8, and Program Change must
    be in 0\.49. They are not supported on the MIDI Link Input, because
    the Link program is always determined by the parameters in the Main
    program.</li>
  <li>Pitch MSB/LSB messages are supported.</li>
  <li>The {MIDI_polyphonic_controls Note Select} control is supported for
    levers, pedals, volume and pan, except on a channel that is part of an MPE
    zone.</li>
  <li>The Note Select (a.k.a.
    {MIDI_Portamento_Controller Portamento Controller}) control is supported
    for Note On, and causes internal note numbers to be remapped as needed. It
    is not supported on a channel that is part of an MPE zone.</li>
  <li>The Main and Link transpositions transpose the pitch and the note number
    by the same amount. This ensures that, as long as Pitch MSB messages
    aren't used on input, they won't be used when the transposed
    results are sent to the Record output. If the Main and Link transpositions
    result in out-of-range note numbers or pitches, those notes are
    discarded.</li>
  <li>The mapping of input notes to output notes is determined independently
    for each key based on the transpose parameters in effect at the time the
    key is pressed. Controls are discarded if they are transposed out of
    range.</li>
  <li>The raw Ribbon input is purely monophonic, and is treated as a unipolar
    value, where 0 means the ribbon isn't touched, and 1 through 16383
    represent the full mechanical range of the ribbon from left to right. Any
    external ribbon controller must ensure that when the finger is lifted, the
    value cleanly switches to zero, with no in-between value that would be
    misinterpreted as a spurious motion. The {_preprocessor} translates this
    into a bipolar modulation source according to the
    {Common_ribbon_algorithm} {_parameter}.</li>
  </ul>
