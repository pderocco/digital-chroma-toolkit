<p><em>cluster:</em> In the Toolkit, a group of related parameters, or the
{_popup} that displays those parameters. Clusters are used because there are
too many {_parameter parameters} to fit onto the screen at once. They are also
sometimes treated as a unit, as when moved or copied to another compatible set
of parameters, or reset to their default values.</p>
