<h1>MIDI Program Get Attributes</h1>
<p>NRPN 82,0 on the Editor input channel reads back the
  {MIDI_program_attributes attributes} and {_timestamp} of the current
  {_program} in the Main {_instrument} as a {MIDI_Program_Set_Attributes} NRPN
  18,0. The Bank MSB and Data MSB values are ignored, but the latter must still
  be sent to trigger the operation.</p>
