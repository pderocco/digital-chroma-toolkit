<h1>MIDI Program Write Metadata</h1>
<p>NRPN 20,0 writes text metadata to a file, or reports the metadata when
  requested, or when the file changes. The Bank MSB and the Data MSB specify
  the bank and program number.</p>
<p><i>Editor input:</i> This replaces the text metadata in the specified file
  with the contents of the preceding
  {MIDI_metadata_sysex}, bumps the {_timestamp} to the present,
  and echoes the message. The timestamp, architecture, version, link
  parameters, and sequence parameters in the Sysex are validated but otherwise
  ignored, but the correct values, including the updated timestamp, are
  included in the echo. If the file didn't exist, a Chroma program is
  created with default parameter values plus the specified metadata.</p>
<p><i>Editor output:</i> This is sent back in response to
  {MIDI_Program_Read_Metadata} NRPN 84,0 on the Editor input channel, preceded
  by a Program Sysex containing the file data, or no Sysex if the file is
  missing. It is also sent in response to {MIDI_Program_Write} NRPN 19,0,
  {MIDI_Program_Write_Metadata} NRPN 20,0, or any modification of a file via
  the network or an external drive operation, under the assumption that an
  editor needs to keep track of the metadata and timestamp of every file, but
  not all its data. The link and sequence parameters are included in the
  metadata because they are considered generally useful to an editor, since
  they describe the relationships among programs.</p>
<p><i>Record output, Playback input, External input:</i> Not supported.</p>
