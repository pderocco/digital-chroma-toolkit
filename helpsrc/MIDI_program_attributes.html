<h1>MIDI program attributes</h1>
<p>When a {_program} is copied into a virtual {_instrument} for playing,
  several attributes of the program file are remembered in the instrument:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Program Number (1 to 50).</li>
  <li>The Program Bank (1 to 9).</li>
  <li>The Program Flags, which is the modification status (0 = scratch, 1 =
    unmodified, 2 = modified), plus 4 if the program has text metadata.</li>
  </ul>
<p>The program also has a timestamp that indicates when the program data was
  last modified, and is recorded as part of the program. If a file
  doesn't exist, it has no timestamp, and loading the file produces a
  {_scratch_program}. The timestamp of the program in an instrument is set to
  the present whenever a parameter is changed. When a program is stored, the
  Bank and Number are changed according to where the program is stored, and the
  timestamp is written to the file along with its parameters.</p>
<p>The comparison between the timestamp of the program in the instrument and
  the file corresponding to the Program Number and Bank determines the bottom
  two bits of the Program Flags attribute, which can have three values:</p>
<table class="vt">
  <tr>
    <td width="5%"/>
    <td width="5%">0</td>
    <td width="15%">Scratch</td>
    <td>The program in the instrument has no timestamp. This means it was
      loaded from a non-existent file, and no parameters have been modified
      since, so all parameter have their default values.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>Unmodified</td>
    <td>The program in the instrument has a valid timestamp which matches the
      file it is associated with. This means the program was loaded from (or
      stored into) the file identified by the Program Number and Bank
      attributes, and no parameters have been modified since.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>Modified</td>
    <td>The program in the instrument has a valid timestamp that doesn't
      match the file it is associated with. This means that at least one
      parameter in the program has been modified (or that the program file
      itself was independently modified).</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
<p>Changing a parameter sets these two bits to Modified because it bumps the
  timestamp on the program in the player to the present, so that it no longer
  matches the timestamp on the file. Loading a program sets them to Unmodified
  (or Scratch) because it receives the same timestamp as the file. And storing
  a modified program sets them to Unmodified because the file is given the
  same timestamp.</p>
<p>Bit 2 of the Program Flags attribute is set if the program has any text
  metadata. This is text appended to a program by an external editor to hold
  additional information about the program. The Digital Chroma preserves
  this, but never changes it.</p>
