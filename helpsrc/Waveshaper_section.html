<h1>WAVESHAPER section</h1>
<p>{waveshaper-section.png width=520}</p>
<p>A {_waveshaper} turns the frequency generated by an {_oscillator} into a
  useful waveshape. <i>WAVESHAPER A</i> is always paired with <i>OSCILLATOR
  A</i>, and the <i>B</i> channel is similarly paired.</p>
<p>The Digital Chroma supports the same waveshapes as the original Chroma, the
  saws, pulse, and noise shapes, but also adds simple single-operator FM
  sounds, and an impulse which can be useful with a highly resonant filter. Its
  parameter {_cluster clusters} incude:</p>
<ul>
  <li>One {Waveshaper_shape_cluster shape} cluster. The {_button} shows the
    current <i>shape</i>, and the {_slider} controls the <i>width</i>.</li>
  <li>Two {Waveshaper_mod_cluster mod} clusters. The buttons show the current
    <i>mod select</i> and the slider controls the <i>mod depth</i>.</li>
  </ul>
