<h1>MIDI NRPN functions</h1>
<p>This section lists all the {_NRPN} messages understood by the Digital
  Chroma, explains their content, and lists what {MIDI_dialects dialects} they
  are meaningful in.</p>
<p>External devices send messages to the Digital Chroma to make it do things.
  The instrument can be played via Note On/Off and various controls, but NRPNs
  are used for things like program operations (beyond Program Select), or
  parameter changes.</p>
<p>The Digital Chroma sends messages to other devices to tell it what it is
  doing. When the instrument is played, it can send Note On/Off and various
  controls, but it uses NRPNs to report program operations and parameter
  changes.</p>
<p>NRPNs are primarily used in the Editor dialects, so that an editor like the
  Toolkit can control the Digital Chroma and also track operations that are
  performed directly on the instrument's control panel. When it sends a
  message to the Digital Chroma, the instrument obeys it, and then sends back
  the same message it would have sent had the operation been invoked directly
  on its control panel. This guarantees that if operations are done by the
  Toolkit and on the control panel, the Toolkit will receive them in the order
  they are actually processed by the instrument, guaranteeing that the Toolkit
  and the Digital Chroma remain synchronized.</p>
<p>Some NRPNs are used as queries to the Digital Chroma, and send back messages
  that specifically respond to these queries. For instance, the Program Read
  NRPN causes the Digital Chroma to send back a Program Write NRPN preceded by
  a {MIDI_program_sysex program Sysex} containing the actual program data from
  a specific program file. This response is in the same form as an external
  device would send into the Digital Chroma in order to write that file. The
  NRPN MSB of a query is always 64 higher than the NRPN MSB of the
  response.</p>
<p>There are also a few miscellaneous queries and responses having nothing to
  do with playing. The complete set of operations, with queries in the second
  column, is:</p>
