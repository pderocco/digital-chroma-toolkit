<h1>MIDI Program Set Attributes</h1>
<p>NRPN 18,0 sets the program bank and number associated with the current
  {_program} in the Main {_instrument}, or reports its {_timestamp}, bank,
  number, and flags with a preceding {MIDI_timestamp_sysex}.</p>
<p><i>Editor input:</i> This sets the Program Bank and Number associated with
  the current program in the Main instrument to the Bank MSB and Data MSB
  values in the message. Any preceding timestamp Sysex is consumed but ignored.
  Any Data LSB is ignored.</p>
<p><i>Editor output:</i> This is sent in response to
  {MIDI_Program_Get_Attributes} Sysex 82,0 on the Editor input channel. It is
  preceded by a Timestamp Sysex, and includes a Data LSB containing the
  {MIDI_program_attributes}.</p>
<p><i>Record output, Playback input, External input:</i> Not supported.</p>
<p class="extra">When the Digital Chroma sends this, the editor must expect a
  Data MSB followed by a Data LSB. When the Digital Chroma receives this, it
  only expects a Data MSB, and will ignore any subsequent Data LSB.</p>
