<h1>Old Chroma convert</h1>
<p>Once you've imported old Chroma programs into the Syntech Sysex
  format, or if you already have Chroma files in that format and would like to
  use them in the Digital Chroma, you can use this tool to convert them to the
  Digital Chroma's format. Since each Sysex file contains up to 50
  programs, the conversion produces fifty separate Digital Chroma {_program}
  files.</p>
<p>The Digital Chroma has almost twice as many {_parameter parameters} as the
  old Chroma, and most of the new ones are set to compatible default values. A
  few, however, are presented in this tool, because you may not wish to rely on
  the default values. They include:</p>
<table class="vt">
  <tr>
    <td width="5%"/>
    <td width="20%" class="i">tune shift</td>
    <td>Positive settings stretch the tuning, making the high notes sharp and
      the low notes flat. Negative settings introduce increasing amounts of
      randomization into the tuning. If you like the old Chroma's sour
      tuning, try something like "random 5\c"; if you just want
      it to sound less dry, try "stretch 5\c".</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td class="i">invert</td>
    <td>The preference in the Chroma factory sounds was for pulling {_lever} 2
      to raise the pitch, but the levers were wired up so that pushing the
      levers produced positive modulation values. Therefore, most of the
      programs were configured so that the lever 2 modulation depth was a
      negative number. If your programs are mostly set up like this, then you
      should use the "inverted" choice, at least for lever 2, which
      causes these modulation depths to be made positive. This way, the results
      will agree with your {_global_parameter global}
      {Global_invert <i>invert</i>} parameter settings, instead of
      contradicting them.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td class="i">selective</td>
    <td>These choose whether the levers are configured in normal or
      {_selective} mode. The latter is recommended, since this is a useful
      feature, and it is rarely important that a lever <i>not</i> be
      selective.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td class="i">voice count</td>
    <td>Since the Digital Chroma has so many {_voice voices}, it's often
      worth spending them on fattening the sound, by setting the <i>voice
      count</i> parameter to something greater than 1.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td class="i">pan spread</td>
    <td>If the <i>voice count</i> is greater than 1, this parameter spreads out
      the voices assigned to each note in the stereo field. The default value
      of 90\d is a good choice, although 180\d results in less obvious
      beating, because the mixing takes place more in the air.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td class="i">tune spread</td>
    <td>If the <i>voice count</i> is greater than 1, this parameter should be
      used to detune the voices a little. Something larger than the default
      value of 1\c is probably optimum, perhaps 5\c.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
<p>Since the conversion is a quick operation, you can try a conversion, play
  some of the resulting programs while tinkering with the parameters to find
  the best conversion settings, and then redo the conversion. Of course, all
  programs will end up with the same settings, so you should choose the most
  generally useful settings, to minimize the number of programs you'll
  want to edit individually.</p>
<p>To do the conversion, tap the <i>input file</i> button, navigate to the
  folder containing the Syntech Sysex file, and select the appropriate file.
  After setting the various parameters, you can choose between two destinations
  for the results:</p>

<h2>Converting to a Digital Chroma bank</h2>
<p>{old-chroma-convert-bank.png width=346}</p>
<p>Tapping the "to bank" button presents you with nine numbered
  bank buttons. Choose the bank you wish to overwrite, and then tap
  "convert". As soon as the conversion is complete, you can begin
  playing on those programs.</p>
<p>This overwrites an entire bank of programs. However, all changes to programs
  stored inside the Chroma are protected by the Undo mechanism, so you can undo
  the conversion operation if you write to the wrong bank.</p>

<h2>Converting to a folder</h2>
<p>{old-chroma-convert-folder.png width=346}</p>
<p>Tapping the "to folder" button presents you with a button that
  lets you choose a folder on the computer. The conversion creates fifty files
  in that folder, called "01.chr" through "50.chr". You can later copy them
  into the Digital Chroma using the {Backup_restore} tool.</p>
<p>If you convert into an existing folder, any old files of those names are
  overwritten. Since these are not inside the Digital Chroma, they are not
  protected by the Undo mechanism.</p>

<h2>Program metadata</h2>
<p>This tool provides one more feature. If you want to give all your programs
  names, you can use a plain text editor (e.g., Notepad in Windows, TextEdit on
  the Mac) to prepare a file with the names, one to a line, and store it in the
  same folder as the Syntech Sysex file, with the same name but with the
  extension ".txt". The conversion will use the text in line 1 for
  the name of program 1, and so on. If a line is empty, that program
  won't be named. If there are too few lines, the trailing programs
  won't be named. If there are too many lines, the excess will be
  ignored. Because of the limits of the Digital Chroma's display, you can
  only use basic ASCII characters.</p>
<p>If you screw up the names, it's easy to tweak the text file and re-run
  the conversion, since it is a quick operation.</p>
<p>No comparable function is provided for descriptions. Those must be entered
  manually after the conversion, using the {Program_popup} on each program.</p>
<p>The timestamp assigned to each program reflects when the conversion took
  place. All programs will have slightly different timestamps.</p>

<h2>Errors</h2>
<p>Normally, after a conversion, a light green box saying "success" appears to
  the left of the "convert" button for a second. If any error occurs, a pink
  box with an error message appears instead. In this case, the button changes
  to "dismiss", and you must tap it to dismiss the message before you can retry
  the operation.</p>
