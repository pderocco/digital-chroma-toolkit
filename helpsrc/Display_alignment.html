<h1>Display alignment</h1>
<p>Calibrations 38 and 39 fill the two display windows with red, and connect
  the slider to the horizontal and vertical display offset calibrations,
  respectively. These should be adjusted to line the displays up with the
  windows in the panel, when viewed from a nominal position horizontally above
  the center of the instrument, viewing the displays from about 20\d below
  perpendicular.</p>
<p>These adjust for mechanical position tolerances.
  The {_global_parameter global} Display Position parameter adjusts the
  vertical position relative to this calibration, and should be used to adjust
  for variations in the actual viewing position, depending upon your posture or
  the position of the instrument in your "stack".</p>
