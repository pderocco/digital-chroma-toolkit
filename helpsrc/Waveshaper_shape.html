<h1>WAVESHAPER shape</h1>
<p>These select one of 17 shapes for each {_waveshaper}. Two are based on
  sawtooth waves, where the "saws" shape is the sum of two sawtooth
  waves with a phase difference between them, and "pulse" is the
  difference between two sawtooth waves, thus having the opposite harmonic
  spectrum. That is, where the saws wave has peaks the pulse has notches, and
  vice versa.</p>
<p>The FM shapes are new to the Digital Chroma. They are single operator phase
  modulation sounds, where a sine wave of one multiple of the {_oscillator}
  frequency modulates a sine wave carrier of another multiple, with a number of
  different ratios. For instance, the "FM 3:2" setting uses a
  carrier at three times the oscillator frequency, and a modulator at twice the
  oscillator frequency. They are best understood, however, by listening to them
  first with the {Waveshaper_width width} parameter set to zero, then by slowly
  raising the width to increase the FM amount, to hear how the harmonic content
  evolves.</p>
<p>There are also two FM shapes where the sine wave carrier is modulated by the
  opposite {_channel channel's} oscillator output or its
  {_filter filter's} low-pass output.</p>
<p>Finally, there are two noise types, present in the original Chroma, plus a
  new "impulse" shape that generates a click at the start of the
  note. It is useful for pinging a highly resonant filter; it's duration
  is inversely proportional to the oscillator frequency, but it is otherwise
  unpitched. With these three shapes, the width parameters do nothing.</p>
