<h1>Panel modes</h1>
<p>The two main panel modes are of course Program Select and Parameter Select.
  The switches between PROG SELECT and PARAM SELECT access two more modes,
  which are useful for copying parts of sounds. Pressing either COPY FROM A or
  COPY FROM B causes its LED to flash, indicating that it is waiting for
  another switch to be pressed. Pressing a numbered switch enters Copy From A
  or Copy From B mode, with the specified program as the source. This mode
  behaves like Parameter Select mode, except that selecting any parameter
  copies from the selected source program. And of course, you can hold either
  COPY FROM switch, press a bank number, release the COPY FROM switch, and
  press a program number, to put the panel into a mode where it copies
  parameters from a program in a different bank.</p>
<p>The reason that there is a separate Copy From A and Copy From B is that it
  allows you to copy from A to B or vice versa. To copy from the opposite
  channel in the current program, press EDIT A and then press COPY FROM B twice
  to copy B to A, or press EDIT B and then press COPY FROM A twice to copy A to
  B.</p>
<p>You already know that PROG SELECT has an additional function: to select a
  bank before selecting a program by holding it down like a shift key and
  pressing a bank number. And you know you can select a scratch sound by
  pressing SET SPLIT, 25 while in Program Select mode. You can hold PARAM
  SELECT down and press a number to select that parameter and reset it to its
  scratch value. These all have the side effect of leaving the panel in either
  Program Select or Parameter Select mode. But PROG SELECT and PARAM SELECT
  have one more useful function, which is to abort any pending multi-switch
  operation. When you press a switch like LINK UNISON, its LED begins to flash,
  indicating it is waiting for another switch press. Pressing PROG SELECT or
  PARAM SELECT abandons the link operation and leaves the panel in the
  appropriate mode.</p>
<p>Finally, pressing PARAM SELECT shows the values associated with the five
  sliders at the left end of the panel for a second or so. This information
  also appears whenever you use the sliders, but PARAM SELECT allows you to see
  the settings without changing them.</p>
