<h1>Undo/Redo buttons</h1>
<p>{undo-redo-buttons.png width=192}</p>
<p>These {_button buttons} in the {_Navigation_bar} invoke the Undo and Redo
  functions of the Digital Chroma. They also show what changes are next in line
  for undoing or redoing. This feature makes it really hard to lose any of your
  program data.</p>
<p>The Digital Chroma records undo information for all edits to the
  {_current_program}, as well as all changes to stored programs. This even
  includes bulk changes to stored programs, as a result of importing programs
  from an external flash drive. (It doesn't include changes made to the
  flash drive, though.)</p>
<p>As edits are made to the current program, the Digital Chroma
  doesn't record each tiny change as a separate undoable event.
  Instead, it combines consecutive edits into a single change until a certain
  period of inactivity elapses. Other operations, like loading and storing, are
  always recorded as distinct operations. Loading a bank of programs, or all
  programs, from a flash drive is treated as a single operation.</p>
<p class="extra">You can adjust this time with the {_global_parameter global}
  <i>edit timeout</i> parameter in the <em>TOOLS</em> {_screen}, but it is
  initially set to five seconds</p>
<p>When you undo something, the change is moved from the undo list to the
  redo list, so that you can redo it if you change your mind. This means
  that you can go back in time to see what your program sounded like
  earlier, and then go back to the "present" and proceed with your
  editing.</p>
<p>Note however that if you have undone something, and then you perform any
  other undoable operation, all your redo information is discarded.</p>
<p class="extra">This is identical to the way undo and redo work in
  programs like word processors, or the way the Back and Forward buttons
  work in web browsers (and in this help browser).</p>
<p class="extra">Since "doing" anything leaves the redo list empty,
  you can use Redo to start a new undoable edit operation, rather than waiting
  for the timeout, if you think you might want to get back to the current
  state.</p>
<h2>Hotkeys</h2>
  <p>You can press <b>R</b> or <b>U</b> on the keyboard to invoke these
  functions.</p>
