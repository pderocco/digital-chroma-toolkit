<p><em>redo:</em> The operation of undoing the last operation that was
performed on the {_current_program}, or on a stored program. The Digital Chroma
records 100 level of Undo, and of course has a corresponding Redo function. It
uses the obsolete AUTO TUNE switch for Undo, and {_SET_SPLIT}, AUTO TUNE for
Redo. The Toolkit uses the bottom two buttons in the {_Navigation_bar}.</p>
