<h1>Players</h1>
<p>The {_player players} are the interface to the sound generation system. At
  any moment, each player is playing on an active {_instrument} whose sound is
  defined by its own private copy of a {_program}. When a new program is
  selected for a player, either from the control panel or by a received MIDI
  Program Change message, it isn't the same as changing all the parameters,
  because a new instrument is created for the player, containing a copy of the
  new program, and all subsequent notes are played on the new instrument.
  However, if the old instrument is still generating sound, it continues to
  exist as an inactive instrument until all its notes have died out. Notes are
  never artificially truncated or changed in sound by the selection of a new
  program.</p>
<p>When a parameter is changed, it affects the current program in the active
  instrument, but has no effect on any voices that may still be sounding from
  an old instrument. It also has no effect on the original program stored in
  the Digital Chroma's file system. It takes an explicit command, from
  the STORE switch on the panel or from a MIDI message received from the
  Toolkit, to cause a program to be stored from the Main player's active
  instrument back to a file. (Players used for sequence playback aren't
  allowed to modify stored programs.)</p>
<p>If a performance control is changed, on the other hand, it affects all
  notes in a player, regardless of what instrument they are playing on. When a
  program is changed, all performance controls retain their current values,
  because performance controls are attributes of the player, not the
  instrument.</p>
<p>The active instrument of the Main player is special in that its state is
  made visible on the control panel, and accessible to the Toolkit. The program
  number and bank attributes of its program are shown in the program number
  display, the Edit Number and Edit Mode {_parameter parameters} in that
  program determine which other parameter (or A/B pair of parameters) is shown
  in the parameter display, and various {_link_program link}-related
  parameters determine how the preprocessor performs link operations and
  control the states of the link-related LEDs. These panel-related parameters
  have no effect in other players.</p>
