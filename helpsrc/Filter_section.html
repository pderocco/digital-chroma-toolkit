<h1>FILTER section</h1>
<p>{filter-section.png width=520}</p>
<p>A {_filter} modifies the harmonic structure of the sound of a waveshaper by
  filtering out harmonics above/below a certain frequency, and possibly
  emphasizing the harmonics near that frequency. It has the following
  {_parameter} {_cluster clusters}:</p>
<ul>
  <li>One {Filter_tune_cluster tune} cluster. The {_button} shows the current
    filter <i>mode</i> parameter, and the {_slider} controls the basic
    <i>tune</i>, before modulation.</li>
  <li>Five {Filter_mod_cluster mod} clusters. Each cluster button shows the
    current <i>mod select</i> parameter, and the slider controls the <i>mod
    depth</i>. The first modulation cluster also has a
    {Filter_mod1_cluster steps} parameter, for sampling or quantizing.</li>
  <li>One {Filter_resonance_cluster resonance} cluster. The slider controls the
    basic {_resonance}, but it can also be modulated.</li>
  </ul>
