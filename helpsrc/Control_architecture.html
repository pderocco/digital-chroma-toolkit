<h1>Control architecture</h1>
<p>The vast majority of programming {_parameter parameters} are tonal
  parameters. But there are a some that affect the behavior of the instrument
  without changing the sound of individual {_voice voices}:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A {Control_voice_count} parameter that can assign up to four
    voices to each note played. The voices play the same sound, but the
    {Control_tune_spread} and {Control_pan_spread}
    parameters introduce differences into them that makes the overall sound
    spacious and animated, rather like having a flanger or phaser per key.</li>
  <li>A {Common_keyboard_algorithm} parameter determines how
    keys are assigned to voices. The full complement of keyboard algorithms
    from the original Chroma are still present, except for two that don't
    make sense in the context of such a large number of available voices. There
    are also a pair of new "strum" algorithms, in which the bottom
    or top two keys are intercepted and used not to play notes but to generate
    triggers that replay whatever notes are held elsewhere on the keyboard. If
    the other keys are released, then playing the trigger notes will replay the
    last chord but with a very short duration, to roughly simulate the sound of
    strumming on muted strings.</li>
  <li>A {Common_footswitch_mode} parameter determines whether
    the right Sustain {_footswitch} is enabled or not, and what function the
    left footswitch should be assigned to. Its usual function is Sostenuto, but
    can also be used as a note gate (only playing notes if the footswitch is
    depressed), or an inverted note gate (only playing notes if it is not
    depressed). And unlike the original Chroma, it can also function as a
    {_glide} enable.</li>
  </ul>
