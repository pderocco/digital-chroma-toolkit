<h1>Current Program popup</h1>
<p>{current-program-popup.png width=288}</p>
<p>This pops up when you {_long-press} the {Program_Info_button}, and
  shows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The optional program name</li>
  <li>The optional description</li>
  <li>The program's {_timestamp}</li>
  <li>Five action {_button buttons}</li>
</ul>
<p class="extra">As with all popups, you can dismiss it by clicking or
  tapping in the dimmed area around it, or on its title.</p>
<p>The name can be modified by clicking or tapping within the <i>name</i> box,
  and using the keyboard to edit the name. Press Enter to accept the new name,
  and you'll see the <i>timestamp</i> change to the present.</p>
<p class="extra">This only changes the {_current_program}. To keep the change,
  you need to use the "store" button, below.</p>
<p>The description can be modified in a similar manner. Since this may have
  multiple lines, Enter starts a new line, but two Enters at the end accepts
  the change.</p>
<p>The timestamp shows when the program was created or most recently
  modified, with 100\us resolution.</p>
<p class="extra">Timestamps allow the Digital Chroma to know immediately if
  two programs are the same, without comparing all the parameters.</p>
<p>The "store" button stores the program under its current
  number.</p>
<p class="extra">You can always use the <i>Undo</i> button in the
  Navigation bar if you do this by mistake.</p>
<p>The "exchange" button exchanges the program with its stored
  version.</p>
<p class="extra">Exchanging them repeatedly while playing allows you to
  compare them easily, which is why this button doesn't dismiss the
  popup. You can keep track of which is which by looking at the timestamps.</p>
<p>The "scratch" button resets all parameters to their default
  values, and deletes the name and description.</p>
<p class="extra">A scratch program doesn't have a timestamp until you
  begin to edit it.</p>
<p>The "stash" button stashes a copy of the current program, 
  and the "recover" button recovers it. Since stashing occurs
  in the Toolkit, and not in the Digital Chroma, it isn't undoable, but
  it also has no effect on undo/redo.</p>
<p class="extra">This means that you can go back in time with Undo, stash
  that earlier program, Redo back to the "present", and then
  recover and store that program. If you had used Undo to get back to that
  earlier program, and immediately stored it, all the Redo information
  would have been lost, and you wouldn't be able to get back to the
  "present".</p>
<h2>Hotkeys</h2>
<p>Pressing <b>L</b> on the keyboard reloads the current program, discarding
  any edits. Pressing <b>S</b> stores it under its current number.</p>
<p class="extra">These obviously don't work while you're typing
into the <i>name</i> or <i>description</i> fields.</p>
