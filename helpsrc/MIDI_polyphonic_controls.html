<h1>MIDI polyphonic controls</h1>
<p>The Digital Chroma also uses CC84, Portamento Controller, which it calls
  "Note Select", for another purpose: to direct an immediately
  following control to a specific note. If that control doesn't support
  polyphony, it is ignored, rather than being treated as a mono control. But
  whether it is ignored or not, the Note Select control is consumed so that
  subsequent controls are unaffected.</p>
<p>This feature works on Pitch Bend, and Control Changes for the levers,
  pedals, ribbon, volume, and pan. It doesn't work for Mono Pressure,
  because MIDI already provides a Poly Pressure message. Also, only one Note
  Select control is needed before hi-res controls.</p>
<p>The Digital Chroma only generates these when an External input port is
  placed in MPE Mode, an external controller uses it to generate polyphonic
  controls, and the MIDI output is being sent to an external DAW for
  recording.</p>
<p class="extra">Portamento Controller/Note Control isn't recognized on
  any of the channels in an MPE zone.</p>
