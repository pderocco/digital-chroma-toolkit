<p><em>long-press:</em> In the Toolkit, touching a {_control}, waiting at least
half a second, and then releasing. While a regular {_tap} invokes the
control's normal function, a long-press invokes a secondary function,
such as resetting a {_parameter} to its default value, or opening a
{_link_help Help link} in a new {_tab}.</p>
