<h1>COMMON ribbon algorithm</h1>
<p>This sets how the value generated by the optional {_ribbon} controller is
  affected by touching, sliding, and releasing.</p>
<table class="vt">
  <tr>
    <td width="5%"/>
    <td width="17%">short release</td>
    <td>When the ribbon is touched, that position is defined as zero, and all
      values are relative to that position. The \+1 {_unit} range equals
      1/16 of the physical length of the ribbon, so small gestures are all that
      is needed. When the ribbon is released, the value resets to zero.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td>short hold</td>
    <td>Same as short release, but the value remains where it is when the
      ribbon is released.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td>short smooth</td>
    <td>Same as short hold, but the initial touch point is defined as the
      current value, so only sliding changes the value.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td>medium \.</td>
    <td>Same as the short versions, but the \+1 unit range equals one
      quarter of the physical length of the ribbon.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td>long \.</td>
    <td>Same as the short and medium versions, but the \+1 unit range
      equals the full physical length of the ribbon, so large gestures are
      usable, and fine resolution is achievable.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td>fixed release</td>
    <td>The \+1 unit range maps directly to the position along the full
      ribbon, so touching the ribbon immediately jumps to that value. When the
      ribbon is released, the value resets to zero.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td>fixed hold</td>
    <td>Same as fixed release, but the value remains where it is when the
      ribbon is released.</td>
