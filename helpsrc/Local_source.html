<p>Performance events come from the following hardware:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The keyboard, which generates Note On and Note Off messages. When output
    via MIDI, these have the obvious MIDI equivalents.</li>
  <li>The {_lever levers}, {_pedal pedals} and {_footswitch footswitches},
    which generate monophonic Note Control messages. When output via MIDI,
    these are encoded as various Control Changes.</li>
  <li>The optional pressure sensor, which generates polyphonic Note Control
    messages. When output via MIDI, these are encoded as Note Pressure.</li>
  <li>The optional {_ribbon} controller, which generates monophonic Note
    Control messages. When output via MIDI, these are encoded as Control
    Changes.</li>
  </ul>
<p>In addition, the panel generates the following programming controls:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Parameter messages specifying {_parameter} changes. This includes tonal
    parameters changed by the parameter slider, and panel parameters changed as
    a result of pressing buttons. These are encoded as {_NRPN NRPNs}.</li>
  <li>Program messages to select a {_program}. Over MIDI, these are encoded as
    a Bank MSB Control Change followed by a Program Change.</li>
  <li>Program messages to store a program, or perform other functions on a
    program. Over MIDI, these are encoded as a Bank MSB Control Change followed
    by an NRPN, sometimes preceded by a {_Sysex}.</li>
  </ul>
