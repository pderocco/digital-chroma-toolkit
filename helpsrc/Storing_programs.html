<h1>Storing programs</h1>
<p>If you've edited a {_program}, and you want to store it under the same
  program number, you can do that from any screen by
  {_long-press long-pressing} the {Program_Info_button} (the second button in
  the {Navigation_bar}), and then {_tap tapping} the "store" button.
  Even easier, just hit <b>S</b> on the keyboard.</p>
<p>But if you wish to store a program under a new number, you have to do that
  from the <em>Programs</em> screen. You long-press the button of the desired
  program location to display the {Program_popup}, and then tap the
  "store" button.</p>
<p>Occasionally, it's useful to exchange the current program with a
  stored program. This is done from the same popup by tapping the
  "exchange" button. When you do this, the current program number
  doesn't change. Repeating the function exchanges them again, getting
  back to where you started, although {Undo_Redo_buttons Undo} (or pressing
  <b>U</b> on the keyboard) is easier.</p>
