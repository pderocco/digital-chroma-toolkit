<h1>Additional link parameters</h1>
<p>LINK LOWER and LINK UPPER use a {Common_keyboard_split}
  {_parameter} to determine which notes go to which {_instrument}. This is set
  by pressing {_SET_SPLIT} and then pressing the key that should become the
  bottom note of the upper part of the keyboard. Pressing SET SPLIT twice sets
  the split point to the same place it was set to the last time it was set in
  this manner.</p>
<p>Above the {_link_program link} switches are transposition switches, which allow
  the Main and Link sounds to be transposed up or down one octave. Pressing a
  switch that is off turns it on and the other one off; pressing a switch that
  is on turns it off, setting the transposition to zero. The main transposition
  is in effect at all times, even if there is no link in effect. When a unison
  link is in effect, it allows the same key to play two different notes, one or
  two octaves apart. You can press a main transpose switch and a link transpose
  switch at the same time to change them both quickly.</p>
<p>When a link is set up (or reselected by pressing a link switch twice), the
  parameter slider is connected to a special panel parameter called
  {Common_link_balance}. This adjusts the relative volumes of the
  Main and Link sounds, with a \+15db range. There are also two extended
  parameters in the Main program, called {Common_link_spread} and
  {Common_link_detune}. The former causes the Main and Link sounds to be pushed
  to opposite sides of the stereo panning range. The latter causes the Main and
  Link sounds to be detuned in opposite directions (using half-scale detuning).
  The point of all three of these parameters is to allow differences to be
  introduced between the Main and Link, without having to load, edit and store
  the Link sound. It also works on a unison "link to self" even though the Main
  and Link instruments are playing the same program.</p>
