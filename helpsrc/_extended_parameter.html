<p><em>extended parameter:</em> On the Digital Chroma's control panel, a
{_parameter} that wasn't present in the original Chroma, and that is
accessed by pressing {_SET_SPLIT} before the numbered switch. This nearly
doubles the number of possible parameters. In the Toolkit, no distinction is
made between regular and extended parameters.</p>
