<h1>AMPLIFIER post mod depth</h1>
<p>These adjust the amount of post modulation that applies to each
  {_amplifier amplifier's} volume. They apply a reduction <i>after</i>
  the two primary sources (normally {_envelope envelopes}) are added
  together.</p>
<p>When set to "off", the post modulation has no effect, and the
  volume is normal. When set to 50%, most sources can vary the volume from 50%
  to 100%. When set to 100%, most sources can vary the volume from zero to
  100%. When set to a negative value, the modulation reduces the volume across
  its range, rather than increasing it.</p>

<h3>Unipolar modulation</h3>
<p>Most mod sources have a 0 to 1 {_unit} range. The following graphs show the
  response at various positive and negative depths:<p>
<table class="p0">
  <tr>
    <td width="5%"/>
    <td>{amplifier-post-mod-graph-unipolar.png width=700}</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
<p>The blue lines represent 0 units of input and output, and the green lines
  represent 1 unit of input and output. The red dots show where the curve
  pivots around, which is different for positive and negative depths. (These
  dots aren't shown in the graph in the cluster popup.)</p>

<h3>Bipolar modulation</h3>
<p>Most sweep wave shapes have a \+1 unit range, as does the optional
  {_ribbon} controller. Since the volume can't go negative (it is clamped
  at zero), mod depths outside a \+50% range aren't useful.
  However, for ribbon, one might wish to use a \+100% range, and only use
  half the ribbon, since some ribbon algorithms always start at zero when you
  touch it, or return to zero when you release it.</p>

<h3>Pitch modulation</h3>
<p>The pitch varies from \-1 to almost +1 unit across the keyboard, but
  can go further with octave transposition, and further still via MIDI. The
  darker regions represent the notes outside the normal keyboard range. As you
  can see, the most useful settings are lower values, allowing you to introduce
  a modest variation in volume across the keyboard:</p>

<h2>Toolkit</h2>
<p>These are contained in the
  {Amplifier_post_mod_cluster Amplifier post mod clusters} within the
  {Amplifier_section}.</p>

<h2>Chroma panel</h2>
<p>These are contained in the <i>VOLUME</i> section of the right panel, under
  the following parameter number:</p>
<table class="p0">
  <tr>
    <td width="10%"/>
    <td>{sw-set-split.png height=48}{sw-50.png height=48}</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
<p>They appear in the display as Amp Post Mod Depth.</p>

<h2>MIDI</h2>
<p>These are accessed via the following {_NRPN NRPNs}:</p>
<table class="p0">
  <tr>
    <td width="6%"/>
    <td width="4%">A</td>

    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td>B</td>
    <td>2,75</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
<p>Since these are {_bipolar} parameters, the values are offset by 64.</p>
