<h1>Program popup</h1>
<p>{program-popup.png width=288}</p>
<p>This pops up when you {_long-press} a {_program} {_button} on the
  {Programs_screen <em>Programs</em>} screen, and shows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The optional program name</li>
  <li>The optional description</li>
  <li>The program's {_timestamp}</li>
  <li>Thirteen action buttons</li>
</ul>
<p class="extra">As with all popups, you can dismiss it by clicking or
  tapping in the dimmed area around it, or on its title.</p>
<p>The name of the stored program can be modified by clicking or tapping within
  the <i>name</i> box, and using the keyboard to edit the name. Press Enter to
  accept the new name, and you'll see the <i>timestamp</i> change to the
  present.</p>
<p class="extra">If the stored program matches the {_current_program}, this
  also modifies the current program, so they still match. If they don't match,
  the current program is unaffected.</p>
<p>The description can be modified in a similar manner. Since this may have
  multiple lines, Enter starts a new line, but two Enters at the end accepts
  the change.</p>
<p>The timestamp shows when the program was created or most recently
  modified, with 100\us resolution.</p>
<p>The "select" button does the same as tapping the program button
  on the main screen.</p>
<p>The "store" button stores the current program under this program
  number.</p>
<p class="extra">If you change the name and then store the current program, the
  new name is overwritten. If you want to store the current program under a new
  name, store the program first, then reopen the popup and change the name. The
  same is true of the description.</p>
<p>The "exchange" button exchanges the current program with this
  stored program. The current program number doesn't change.</p>
<p>The "store stash" button stores the stashed program under this
  program number. This is whatever was previously "stashed" in the
  {Current_program_popup}.</p>
<p>The "delete" button deletes the stored program, turning its
  button gray.</p>
<p>The various "link" buttons set the {_link_program link} parameter in
  the current program to refer to this stored program, and sets the link mode.
  The seven choices are:</p>
<table class="vt">
  <tr><td width="2%"/>
    <td width="20%">link upper</td>
    <td>The portion of the keyboard below the keyboard split point plays the
      Main program, and the upper portion plays the Link program.</td></tr>
  <tr><td/>
    <td>link upper unison</td>
    <td>The entire keyboard plays the Main program, and the upper portion also
      plays the Link program.</td></tr>
  <tr><td/>
    <td>link unison</td>
    <td>The entire keyboard plays both the Main and Link programs.</td></tr>
  <tr><td/>
    <td>link lower unison</td>
    <td>The entire keyboard plays the Main program, and the lower portion also
      plays the Link program.</td></tr>
  <tr><td/>
    <td>link lower</td>
    <td>The upper portion of the keyboard plays the Main program, and the lower
      portion plays the Link program.</td></tr>
  <tr><td/>
    <td>link external</td>
    <td>The internal keyboard plays the Main program, and an external keyboard
      plays the Link program.</td></tr>
  <tr><td/>
    <td>link internal</td>
    <td>An external keyboard plays the Main program, and the internal keyboard
      plays the Link program.</td></tr>
  </table>
<p class="extra">The last two require that an external keyboard be connected to
  the serial MIDI port or one of the {_USB_host_port USB host ports}, and that
  the global {Global_midi_link_in MIDI Link Input} parameter select a channel
  on that particular port.</p>
<p>The "sequence program" button sets that {_parameter} in the
  current program to refer to this stored program. This means that when the
  {_sequence_program Sequence Program} footswitch is pressed, this program will
  automatically be selected.</p>
<p class="extra">Note: if the current program isn't otherwise modified,
  changing the sequence program parameter also stores the current program after
  making the change, since this parameter isn't useful except if it is
  made part of a stored program. If the current program has already been
  modified, it isn't automatically stored, since it is up to you whether
  you want those other modifications to be stored or not.</p>
<h2>Bank parameters</h2>
<p>When you select a program to link to (or a program to sequence to), it
  matters whether the current bank selection at the top of the
  <em>Programs</em> screen is a number, or <i>current</i>. If it is
  <i>current</i> (the usual case), the link (or sequence program) parameter is
  set to a one- or two-digit number, with no bank number specified, indicating
  a reference to the bank containing the current program. If a bank number is
  highlighted, then the parameter is set to a three-digit number, in which the
  bank is explicit.</p>
<p>The difference is important if you later store or move the program to a new
  bank. If the bank number is only one or two digits, then it will refer to the
  new bank, and perhaps the wrong program. On the other hand, if you are likely
  to move an entire bank of programs, by saving them to a flash drive and then
  reloading them into a different bank, then one- and two-digit bank numbers
  are correct, since the targets will have been moved too. If you want a
  3-digit program number, you must explicitly select the appropriate bank
  button at the top of the screen before displaying the popup.</p>
