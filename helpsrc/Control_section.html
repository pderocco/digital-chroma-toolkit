<h1>CONTROL section</h1>
<p>{control-section.png width=384}</p>
<p>This section contains miscellanous sound {_parameter}
  {_cluster clusters}:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The {Control_patch_cluster} only contains the
    <i>{Control_patch}</i> parameter, but this is perhaps the most
    important single parameter, since it controls how the sound processing
    modules are interconnected. Diagrams are provided for each choice.</li>
  <li>The {Control_selectivity_cluster} only contains the
    parameters that control the {_selective selectivity} of the various
    controllers.</li>
  <li>The {Control_tone_cluster} contains controls for a
    three-band parametric equalizer, plus a distortion control, plus parameters
    that override the reverb performance controls.</li>
  <li>The {Control_detune_cluster} lets you detune the <i>B</i>
    oscillator relative to the <i>A</i>, and to either stretch or randomize the
    overall tuning.</li>
  <li>The {Control_voice_stack_cluster} lets you assign up
    to four {_voice voices} per note, and spread them out in tuning and pan
    position.</li>
  </ul>
