<h1>ENVELOPE decay cluster</h1>
<p>{envelope-decay-cluster.png width=373}</p>
<p>This contains a {Envelope_decay_time <i>time</i>} {_slider} to set the time
  it takes for the envelope to drop toward zero once it has completed its
  attack phase. Since it slows down as it approaches zero, and theoretically
  never gets there, this is actually the "time constant",
  indicating how long it would have taken to get to zero if it didn't
  slow down. The {_default_value} is infinity, for a note that lasts as long as
  the key is held.</p>
<p>This also includes two modulation inputs. The
  {Envelope_decay_self_mod <i>self mod</i>} slider determines how much the
  decay time is affected by its own value. When set to a negative value, it
  causes the initial decay to be sped up; setting it to a large negative value
  yields a very short initial spike and a long tail, but the lower the
  envelope amplitude, the less of a spike.</p>
<p>The {Envelope_decay_mod_select <i>mod select</i>} {_button buttons} and
  {Envelope_decay_mod_depth <i>mod depth</i>} {_slider} allow the decay time
  to be modulated by either {_lever} or {_pedal}, the note pitch, the
  {_velocity}, or the optional pressure sensor. Positive modulation increases
  the decay time, negative modulation decreases it.</p>
