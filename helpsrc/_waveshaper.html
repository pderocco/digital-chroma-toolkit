<p><em>waveshaper:</em> A sound processing module that takes the frequency
generated by the {_oscillator} in the same {_channel}, and turns it into one of
a number of possible wave shapes. The two basic shapes are "saws",
which is a pair of sawtooth waves with a phase difference controlled by the
Width parameter, and "pulse" which is a variable width pulse; the
two have opposite harmonic spectra. The Digital Chroma also adds simple
single-oscillator FM sounds with various carrier to modulator ratios, and can
also modulate a sine wave by the opposite channel's oscillator or
{_filter} output. Finally, it supports the "pink noise" and
"white noise" choices that the original Chroma had, plus an
"impulse" shape that is useful for pinging a highly
{_resonance resonant} filter. These last three choices ignore the width
control, and the noise choices ignore the oscillator input.</p>
<p><i>Also:</i> {_oscillator}, {_filter}, {_amplifier}</p>
