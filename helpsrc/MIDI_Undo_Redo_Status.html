<h1>MIDI Undo/Redo Status</h1>
<p>NRPN 50,0 is sent by the Digital Chroma on the Editor output channel in
  response to {MIDI_Undo_Redo_Request} NRPN 114,0, or to report changes in the
  descriptions of what events are next in line for Undo and Redo. It is
  preceded by a Sysex containing two concatenated strings, the first describing
  the next Undo operation in line, the second describing the next Redo
  operation in line. The Data MSB contains the length of the first string. If
  there is nothing to Undo or Redo, the corresponding part of the string is
  empty.</p>
<p>When Undo or Redo is invoked from the control panel, or when the editor
  sends in any undoable message, or when the control panel does something
  undoable, or when an external drive or network operation modifies program
  files, this is normally sent after any messages reflecting the changes.
  However, certain consecutive events, like edits to the current program, are
  combined into a single undoable event. Since only the first event changes the
  description of what's next in line for Undo and Redo, only the first
  event sends this message.</p>
<p>Each description matches what will be shown in the Digital Chroma's
  display for a second after Undo or Redo is invoked. Typical messages are:</p>
<ul>
  <p>Load 104</p>
  <p>Edit 217</p>
  <p>Store 113</p>
  <p>External modification</p>
  </ul>
<p>The last one indicates an external drive or network operation that altered
  one or more program files.</p>
