<h1>MIDI pitch controls</h1>
<p>The Digital Chroma allows the pitch of a note to be specified independently
  of its note number, using the following two Digital Chroma-specific
  controls:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="5%"/>
    <td width="10%">CC86</td>
    <td>Pitch LSB</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td>CC87</td>
    <td>Pitch MSB</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
<p>Either of these, or both in either order, must be sent immediately before
  the Note On in order to alter its pitch. If the MSB is sent, it specifies
  the semitone, and the note number becomes a mere label used in the Note Off,
  or in polyphonic controls. If the LSB is sent, it is treated as a bipolar
  offset, where 0 is 50 cents flat, 64 is neutral, and 127 is almost 50 cents
  sharp. These values are consumed by the Note On, so that subsequent notes
  are unaffected. This means that the full range of pitches actually goes from
  \-0.5 to almost 127.5.</p>
<p>The Digital Chroma uses this feature when a MIDI input port is in MPE mode,
  so that it can combine all the channels in the zone into the master channel.
  To do this, it translates Note On into Pitch MSB with the actual note
  number, followed by Note On with the note number equal to the zero-based
  channel number. This allows more than one MPE channel to play the same note
  at the same time. If the result is sent out to a DAW for external recording,
  this is how the notes will appear.</p>
<p>It also uses this feature for the poly ordered keyboard algorithms, to
  control which old notes glide to which new notes, by assigning them to note
  numbers 0, 1, 2, etc. from the top note down. It also uses it in all the
  mono and arpeg keyboard algorithms, by using note number 0 for
  everything.</p>
