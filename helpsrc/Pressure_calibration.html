<h1>Pressure calibration</h1>
<p>If you have an optional pressure sensor, you must enable it by selecting
  calibration 33. If it is disabled, the display says "Press again to
  enable", so press 33 a second time. When it is enabled, this
  calibration functions like the {Velocity_calibration}, connecting the
  {_parameter_control} to the \+10 pressure calibration for the last key
  played. If you don't have a pressure sensor, leave this disabled, so
  that the Chroma won't scan the nonexistent sensors and generate random
  pressure values.</p>
<p>You can disable the pressure sensor by selecting calibration 34. If it is
  enabled, the display says "Press again to disable and reset", so
  press 34 again. If you need to reset all the calibrations to zero, disable
  the sensor, and then press 33 twice to re-enable it.</p>
