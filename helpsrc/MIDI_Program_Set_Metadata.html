<h1>MIDI Program Set Metadata</h1>
<p>NRPN 17,0 sets the text metadata in the current {_program} in the Main
  {_instrument}, or reports its {_timestamp}, metadata, and other
  attributes.</p>
<p><i>Editor input:</i> This replaces the text metadata in the program in the
  Main instrument with the contents of the preceding Metadata Sysex, bumps the
  timestamp to the present, and echoes the message. The timestamp,
  architecture, version, link parameters, and sequence parameters in the Sysex
  are validated and otherwise ignored, but the correct values, including the
  updated timestamp, are contained in the echo. The Bank MSB and Data MSB
  values are ignored, but the latter must still be sent to trigger the
  operation. No new instrument is created, because the metadata has no effect
  on the sound. If the current program is a scratch program, a Chroma program
  is created containing all default values, plus whatever metadata are supplied
  by the Sysex.</p>
<p><i>Editor output:</i> This is sent in response to
  {MIDI_Program_Get_Metadata} Sysex 81,0 on the Editor input channel. The
  timestamp and architecture are current, the version is the latest, and the
  Bank MSB and Data MSB values reflect the current program bank and number. For
  a scratch program, no Sysex is sent.</p>
<p><i>Record output, Playback input, External input:</i> Not supported.</p>
