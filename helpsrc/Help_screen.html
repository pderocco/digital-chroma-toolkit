<h1>Help screen</h1>
<p>This is a simple browser that lets you peruse all the documentation for the
Digital Chroma and the Toolkit. It has the following features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It works like a web browser, with blue {_link_help links} you can {_tap}
    or {_click} to navigate to different pages.</li>
  <li>Green links pop up a definition, which you dismiss by tapping outside of.
    It may contain further links, and if you follow a chain of green links, you
    can back up by clicking within the popup.</li>
  <li>If a page is longer than the screen, you can scroll by {_drag dragging}
    the page up or down. You can also use a mouse's scroll wheel. You can
    also {_long-press} in the bottom half (but not on a link) to scroll all the
    way to the end, or in the top half to scroll back to the beginning.</li>
  <li>Clicking or tapping a {question.png height=16} {_button}
    anywhere in the Toolkit switches to the <em>Help</em> screen, to whatever
    {_tab} you were last viewing, and navigates to a page that explains the
    section of the Toolkit containing that button.</li>
  <li>You can open multiple pages in tabs. If you long-press a link, or on a
    {question.png height=16} button, it creates a new tab for
    that page, and you can click or tap the tabs to switch among them.
    Long-pressing a tab closes it; long-pressing the only tab opens a new one
    on the Home page.</li>
  <li>Long-pressing the <em>HELP</em> button switches to the <em>Help</em>
    {_screen}, to the current tab, and navigates to the Home screen.</li>
  <li>As in a web browser, each tab has a history, which you can go back
    through with the {back.png height=16} button at the top of
    the screen. Once you've gone back, you can go forward again with
    {forward.png height=16}.</li>
  <li>All the help pages are organized into an outline, which you can view
    {Help_contents here}, and also navigate in order using the three buttons at
    the bottom of the screen. The {next.png height=16} button
    goes to the next page at the same outline level,
    {previous.png height=16} goes to the previous page, and
    {up.png height=16} goes to the parent page at the next
    higher outline level.</li>
  </ul>
<h2>Hotkeys</h2>
<p>You can scroll a page at a time with "Page Up" and "Page Down", or to the
  beginning or end with "Home" and "End".</p>
<p>You can dismiss a definition popup with "Escape".</p>
<p>You can navigate backward and forward through the history with "\<" and
  "\>", or their unshifted equivalents "," and ".".</p>
<p>You can navigate through the outline with "Left", "Up", and "Right". You can
  also use "Down" to go to the first child of the current page.</p>
<p class="extra">There is no button at the bottom for this because you can just
  click the link within the page.</p>
