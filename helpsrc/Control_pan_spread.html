<h1>CONTROL pan spread</h1>
<p>This controls how much stacked voices are spread out in the stereo field.
  This has no effect unless the {Control_voice_count} parameter is
  greater than 1.</p>
<p>This is expressed in degrees, representing the amount by which centered
  (mono) sounds are spread out by this parameter. When this is zero, all voices
  have the full pan range; when set to 90\d, the outer voices are panned
  half way to the sides, and their instruments each have half the panning
  range; when set to 180\d, the outer voices are forced all the way left and
  right, and the instrument pan controls do nothing.</p>
