<h1>Instrument architecture</h1>
<p>All voices that are playing the same sound belong to the same virtual
  {_instrument}. From the keyboard, you can play on two instruments, called the
  Main and Link, and each {_USB_device_port} MIDI input channel can also play
  on a separate instrument.</p>
<p>The stereo outputs of all voices belonging to a particular instrument are
  summed together, and then processed further. The instrument architecture
  looks like this:</p>
<p>{instrument-architecture.png width=595}</p>
<p>The BASS, MIDDLE and TREBLE modules are stereo tone controls on the combined
  sound from all voices playing on that instrument. The sliders on the panel
  adjust the levels of these tone controls for the Main instrument, but these
  are actually parameters in the program, not master tone controls on the
  final output. While SET SPLIT is flashing, the sliders instead adjust the
  bass, middle, and treble frequencies, and the TUNE slider adjusts the middle
  resonance.</p>
<p>The DISTORTION module is also controlled by an {_extended_parameter} in the
  {_program}.</p>
<p>Reverberation is controlled by a level control and a room select, so the
  output always goes to the dry output, and also goes to one of the rooms.
  These choices are normally performance controls generated by global
  parameters, but there are extended program parameters that can override this,
  in case a particular sound always needs particular reverb settings.</p>
<p>Finally, the instrument also includes some control signal generation:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It generates two sweep phases, for channel A and B, that are common to
    all voices. When one of the mono Sweep modes is selected, the voices get
    their sweep phases from the instrument. This is useful for creating a slow
    sweep that remains coherent even when playing staccato notes.</li>
  <li>It generates two envelopes, for channel A and B, that are common to all
    voices. When one of the mono Envelope 2 modes is selected, the voices copy
    the envelope from the instrument. This is useful for simulating a Hammond
    percussion envelope.</li>
  </ul>
