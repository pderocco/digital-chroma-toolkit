<h1>CONTROL tone cluster</h1>
<p>{control-tone-cluster.png width=373}</p>
<p>All {_voice voices} that belong to a particular virtual {_instrument} are
  combined together and fed into a stereo three-band parametric equalizer, then
  a stereo distortion effect, and finally into one of the reverb rooms. This
  {_cluster} contains seven {_parameter parameters} for controlling the tone,
  one for controlling the distortion, and two for overriding the reverb
  performance controls.</p>
<p>The tone control has long {_slider sliders} for the
  <i>{Control_treble_gain}</i>, the <i>{Control_middle_gain}</i>, and
  the <i>{Control_bass_gain}</i>, and short sliders for the
  treble <i>{Control_treble_frequency frequency}</i>, the
  middle <i>{Control_middle_frequency frequency}</i>, the
  middle <i>{Control_middle_resonance resonance}</i>, and the
  bass <i>{Control_bass_frequency frequency}</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>{Control_distortion}</i> control has one long slider,
  which introduces symmetric (odd harmonic distortion) on the positive side,
  and asymmeteric (even harmonic) on the negative side.</p>
<p>The <i>{Control_reverb_room}</i> control has five buttons for
  selecting the room size, and the <i>{Control_reverb_send}</i>
  slider sets the send level. If <i>reverb room</i> is set to
  "performance", the reverb performance controls derived from the
  {_global_parameter global} <i>reverb room</i> and <i>reverb send</i>
  parameters take effect, and the program's <i>reverb send</i> is ignored.</p>
