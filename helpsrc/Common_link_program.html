<h1>COMMON link program</h1>
<p>This controls what {_program} the current program is {_link_program linked}
  to. It can be either a 1- or 2-digit number to link to the same bank as the
  current program, or a 3-digit number to link to a specific bank. The
  difference is meaningful when the current program is stored in a different
  bank.</p>

<h2>Toolkit</h2>
<p>This is contained in the {Common_link_cluster <i>link</i> cluster} within
  the {Common_section}, but this only allows it to be viewed, and possibly
  reset to its default value of "self" by
  {_long-press long-pressing} the <i>link program</i> button. In general, it is
  set from the {Programs_screen} by {_long-press long-pressing} the program you
  want to link to, to view the {Program_popup}, and then selecting the mode
  there.</p>

<h2>Chroma panel</h2>
<p>A link is set up as described under the {Common_link_mode}
  parameter. A 1- or 2-digit link is set by pressing one or more of the Link
  switches on the left panel, then pressing a numbered switch on the right
  panel. A 3-digit link is set by holding one or more of the Link switches,
  pressing 1 to 9 on the right panel to specify the bank, then separately
  pressing the link program number.</p>
<p>You can also link to "self", which means that the main and link
  {_instrument instruments} play the same program (although they can still have
  separate octave transpositions), and both are edited in parallel. This is
  really only useful with a unison link, and can be selected by holding Link
  Unison and then pressing Prog Select.</p>

<h2>MIDI</h2>
<p>This is accessed as two separate parameters. The bank is set via {_NRPN}
  0,0, and the program by NRPN 0,1. Changing the bank without changing the
  program doesn't immediately load a new program into the link
  instrument.</p>
