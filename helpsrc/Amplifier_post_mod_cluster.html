<h1>AMPLIFIER post mod cluster</h1>
<p>{amplifier-post-mod-cluster.png width=373}</p>
<p>The <i>AMPLIFIER</i> section has one of these for each {_channel}. It
  contains a {Amplifier_post_mod_select <i>mod select</i>} {_parameter} that
  chooses a post modulation that applies after <i>mod 1</i> and <i>mod 2</i>
  are added together, and a {Amplifier_post_mod_depth <i>mod depth</i>}
  parameter that controls how much to vary the volume.</p>
<p>The <i>mod select</i> parameter gives you eight {_lever} and {_pedal}
  choices, the optional {_ribbon} controller, pitch, velocity, the optional
  pressure sensor, or either {_sweep} control signal for tremolo.</p>
<p>The <i>mod depth</i> scales the post modulation around a value of one
  {_unit}, rather than zero. That is, if the depth is turned off (the default),
  you always get 100% of the nominal volume. If it is set to 100%, the post mod
  can vary the volume from zero to 100%. If it is set to 50%, it can vary the
  volume from 50% to 100%. If it is set to a negative value, it can vary from
  100% down to some lesser value.</p>
<p>The rectangular box is actually a graph of the response, and varies when the
  two parameters are adjusted. See the <i>mod depth</i> parameter for details
  on how to interpret these graphs.</p>
