<p><em>voice:</em> A software module capable of playing one note at a time. It
has four pairs of {_control_signal} generators, including two {_glide glides},
two {_sweep sweeps}, two basic {_envelope envelopes}, and two envelopes that
can be delayed or triggered by things other than key presses. It also has four
pairs of sound processing modules, including two {_oscillator oscillators}, two
{_waveshaper waveshapers}, two {_filter filters}, and two
{_amplifier amplifers}, the last of which include output panners.</p>
<p>Note that the Voice Stack {_parameter} allows up to four voices to be
assigned to each note. They all have the same sound, but can be detuned and
spread out in the stereo field.</p>
