<p><em>channel:</em> Half of a {_voice}. Every voice consists of a pair of each
type of {_control_signal} generator, plus a pair of each type of sound
processor, and within each pair are labelled A and B. In some sounds, all the A
components are used together, and all the B components are used together,
producing two sounds that are mixed at the output, which is why they are
sometimes called channels. In the general case, though, the A and B modules can
be freely cross-connected, so they don't function as separate
channels.</p>
