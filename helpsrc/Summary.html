<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>So, to review, the sound of the Chroma is controlled by a set of
  {_parameter parameters}, which are divided into the following categories:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A {_channel} and B channel parameters, each off which affect one half of
    the {_voice}, and which can be adjusted independently or in parallel.</li>
  <li>Control parameters, which affect the entire sound.</li>
  <li>Panel parameters, which have their own switches or sliders.</lli>
  </ul>
<p>Parameters are combined into {_program programs}, which are stored in files.
  Selecting a sound loads a program into the Main {_instrument}, and if its
  {_link_program link} parameters are set, loads a second sound into the Link
  instrument. Edits are always done to the program in the Main instrument, and
  have no effect on stored programs unless explicitly stored with the STORE
  switch.</p>
