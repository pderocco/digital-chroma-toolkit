<h1>SWEEP mode</h1>
<p>These select one of five synchronization modes for the {_sweep}
  generators:</p>
<table class="vt">
  <tr>

    <td width="15%">poly</td>
    <td>Each voice has its own sweep generator. The initial phase when a voice
      is allocated is random, and it runs continuously even if the voice is
      retriggered.</td>

  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td>poly synced</td>
    <td>Each voice has its own sweep generator. The phase starts at 0\d at
      the start of each note.</p>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td>mono</td>
    <td>All voices share the same sweep phase computed by the virtual
      instrument, but each has its own amplitude control. This phase runs
      continuously, independent of the playing of notes.</p>

    <td>mono multiple</td>
    <td>Like the mono mode, except that the phase is reset to 0\d whenever a
      key is pressed.</td>

    <td>mono single</td>
    <td>Like the mono mode, except that the phase is reset to 0\d whenever
      the number of keys held goes from zero to one.</td>
