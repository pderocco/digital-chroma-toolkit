<h1>Program linking</h1>
<p>The Chroma has the ability to select two sounds at a time, either for the
  purpose of layering them (to get four oscillators per note), or for
  splitting the keyboard. This is done by creating a {_link_program} from one
  {_program} to another stored program, embodied in three panel
  {_parameter parameters} in the Main program, called the Link Mode, Link
  Number and Link Bank. When a program containing a link is selected, a second
  {_instrument} is enabled, whose sound is controlled by the program linked to.
  This program can't be edited from the panel; all editing controls only
  affect the Main program.</p>
<p>The link modes inherited from the original Chroma are Link Unison, which
  causes all notes to be played on both the main and link sound, Link Lower,
  which steers the notes below the keyboard split to the link sound, and Link
  Upper, which steers the notes above or equal to the keyboard split to the
  link sound.</p>
<p>A link to a program in the current bank is set up by pressing LINK LOWER,
  LINK UNISON or LINK UPPER and then pressing a number. The link mode is
  changed, without changing what program is linked to, by pressing one of
  those three link switches twice. A link is removed by pressing NO LINK
  twice.</p>
<p>In the Digital Chroma, setting up a link in this manner always links to a
  sound in the same bank as the main sound. Internally, it records the program
  number, but records the link bank parameter as zero, meaning "current
  bank". If the main program is later stored into a different bank, it
  will automatically link to the corresponding program in that bank, which is
  useful if an entire bank full of programs is moved to another bank.</p>
<p>To link to any specific bank, not surprisingly, you hold LINK LOWER, LINK
  UNISON or LINK UPPER, press the bank number, release the link switch, and
  press the program number. This sort of link always links to the specified
  bank, even of the main program that contains the link is moved to a different
  bank. (Again, you can select the bank first with PROG SELECT, but
  that's less efficient.)</p>
<p>The Digital Chroma has another feature which the original Chroma
  didn't have, which is Link to Self. If one of the three LINK switches
  is held like a shift key, and PROG SELECT is pressed, then a link is set up
  to the same program as the main program. But this is somewhat different from
  linking to the stored version of the program, because all parameter changes
  are sent to both instruments, affecting both sounds. This is primarily useful
  with a LINK UNISON, to double the number of oscillators while allowing
  separate octave transposition. But it also means that the link will always be
  to "self", even if the main program is stored under a different
  number, or into a different bank.</p>
<p>Another new feature: you can combine a Link Unison with either Link Lower
  or Link Upper, in which case the link sound plays on part of the keyboard
  while the main plays over the entire keyboard. This is done by pressing LINK
  LOWER or LINK UPPER concurrently with LINK UNISON, and then pressing the
  program number. All the other variations work: for instance, you can hold
  LINK LOWER and LINK UNISON and press 1\.9, then separately press 1\.50 to
  set up a Link Lower Unison to a specific bank; or you can press LINK UPPER
  and LINK UNISON together twice to change the link mode to Link Upper
  Unison.</p>
<p>Finally, you can create a split between the entire keyboard going to the
  main instrument, and an external keyboard going to the link instrument, or
  vice versa. The former is done by pressing LINK LOWER and LINK UPPER
  concurrently, and then pressing the program number, or using any of the
  other analogous variations to specify a different bank or just change the
  link mode. The latter is done by pressing all three LINK switches
  concurrently. The external keyboard may be connected to the serial MIDI port
  or to either {_USB_host_port}, and the {_global_parameter global}
  {Global_midi_link_in MIDI Link Input} parameter must set to the appropriate
  port and channel.</p>
