<h1>MIDI running status</h1>
<p>Serial MIDI allows the status byte of a channel message to be dropped if it
  is the same as the preceding non-real-time status byte, to reduce the data
  rate. Reusing the preceding status is called "running status",
  and isn't allowed for system messages. The Digital Chroma MIDI output
  uses this feature for Control Change, Pitch Bend, Mono Pressure, and Poly
  Pressure messages, because they are the only messages that are likely to be
  transmitted at a high rate. The input properly handles running status for
  all channel messages, though. (None of this is meaningful for USB MIDI.)</p>
<p>Note that the even though the MIDI specification calls the Reset byte (255)
  a system real-time message, it also requires that it clear running status.
  This makes it effectively a system common message, which is how the Digital
  Chroma treats it.</p>
