<h1>Glide generator</h1>
<p>The {_glide Glide} generator is responsible for transforming the note
  numbers coming from the keyboard (subject to the transpose switches) into a
  control signal that goes to the {_oscillator}, and may be used in other
  places. What's called the Rate on the switch is really a time, with
  zero meaning all changes are instant. The original Chroma had two choices of
  Shape:</p>
<table class="vt">
  <tr>
    <td width="5%"/>
    <td width="15%"><i>portamento</i></td>
    <td>the glide smoothly ramps from one pitch to another, taking a certain
      amount of time that is independent of how big the change is.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td><i>glissando</i></td>
    <td>the glide steps by semitones from one pitch to another, at a certain
      fixed rate so that it takes a longer time to cover a wider pitch
      range.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
<p>The Digital Chroma calls the first <i>constant time</i>, and adds two more
  choices:</p>
<table class="vt">
  <tr>
    <td width="5%"/>
    <td width="15%"><i>exponential</i></td>
    <td>the glide ramps from one pitch toward another, with a certain
      "time constant", slowing down and never quite reaching
      it.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td><i>constant slope</i></td>
    <td>the glide ramps from one pitch to another, at a certain fixed rate
      so that it takes a longer time to cover a wider pitch range.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
<p>The Digital Chroma also allows the glide time to be modulated, via the
  {Glide_mod_select} and {Glide_mod_depth} parameters.</p>
<p>Each {_channel} in the {_voice} has its own glide generator, which is
  permanently connected to the oscillator in the same channel. However, the
  glide can be routed to other things as well. It is common to select one of
  the glide generators as a modulation source for the filter. As mentioned
  above, if the modulation depth were set to 32, the filter would exactly track
  the keyboard. But in most sounds, in which the filter isn't
  self-oscillating at a particular pitch, a more natural scaling of the filter
  tuning across the keyboard is attained by setting the modulation depth to
  about half that amount.</p>
<p>It is important to understand that the actual portamento and glissando
  functions interact with the keyboard algorithms. For a normal polyphonic
  algorithm ({Common_keyboard_algorithm} {_parameter} set to zero),
  glide is usually disabled, so the glide generator output acts as though its
  Time parameter was set to zero. This is because there is no consistent way of
  defining what note should glide to what note when chords are being played. In
  monophonic modes, however, the choice is obvious, so glide is enabled by
  default (assuming the Time parameter is nonzero). There are also two special
  polyphonic algorithms that have glide enabled by default:</p>
<table class="vt">
  <tr>
    <td width="5%"/>
    <td width="15%"><i>pitch ordered</i></td>
    <td>notes are delayed slightly to acquire an entire chord, and then notes
      are assigned from highest to lowest.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td><i>chord buffer</i></td>
    <td>notes aren't directly played, but are added to a chord buffer,
      and then played when the left footswitch is pressed.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
<p>In both cases, notes are placed in order before they are actually played, so
  that glide can be meaningfully used from one chord to another.</p>
<p>The {Common_footswitch_mode} parameter also impacts glide, because
  one of the possible functions of the left footswitch (which wasn't
  present in the original Chroma) is glide enable. If this function is
  selected, then it overrides the default choice made by the keyboard
  algorithm. That is, it can forcibly disable the glide for those mono and poly
  modes that normally use glide, and can also forcibly enable it for those poly
  modes that normally don't use glide. When a regular polyphonic mode is
  forced to use glide, it behaves like the Chroma Polaris: when the left
  footswitch is pressed, each new note is assigned not to some idle voice but
  to the most recently assigned voice in the same instrument. This means that
  while the glide is enabled, the keyboard effectively becomes monophonic, even
  though there may be a chord held over from before the footswitch was pressed.
  Unlike the Polaris, this function is enabled by the Fsw Mode parameter, and
  not the Glide Time, so it allows the footswitch to switch to monophonic
  playing even if the Glide Time is set to zero.</p>
