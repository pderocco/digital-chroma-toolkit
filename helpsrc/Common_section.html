<h1>COMMON section</h1>
<p>{common-section.png width=384}</p>
<p>This section contains {_parameter} {_cluster clusters} that aren't
  directly related to the sound generation:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The {Common_sequence_cluster} determines what {_program}
    is selected next, when you tap the {_sequence_program Sequence Program}
    {_footswitch}. Its {_button} shows its current setting.</li>
  <li>The {Common_controllers_cluster} contains the
    keyboard algorithm, and various options for the footswitches and optional
    {_ribbon}.</li>
  <li>The {Common_link_cluster} contains parameters that apply
    when the current program is {_link_program linked} to another stored
    program (or to itself). Its button shows the current link mode and
    program.</li>
  <li>The {Common_edit_cluster} determines what parameter, or A/B
    pair of parameters, is connected to the {_parameter_control} on the Digital
    Chroma's control panel.</li>
  </ul>
<p>It also has two octave transposition parameters, one for the Main sound and
  one for the Link, each of which has three settings, down one octave, normal,
  and up one octave. These are on the main screen since they are often useful
  during performance.</p>
<p>This is called the "common" section because a future version of
  the Digital Chroma may support more than one sound architecture, in which
  case all architectures will have the same set of common parameters.</p>
