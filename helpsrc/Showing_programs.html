<h1>Showing programs</h1>
<p>The <em>Programs</em> screen normally shows one bank of {_program programs},
  as an array of fifty {_button buttons}. Each button shows a program number,
  and if that program exists and has a name, shows the name as well. If a
  particular numbered program doesn't exist, its button is gray.</p>
<p>If a stored program matches the {_current_program}, its button is tinted
  light green. If its number matches, but its contents don't, it is
  tinted pink instead.</p>
<p class="extra">This happens as soon as you begin to edit the current program.
  It also can happen if you use the <em>Programs</em> screen to modify the
  stored program.</p>
<p>To show a different bank, click one of the bank numbers at the top. To show
  the current bank (the bank containing the current program) again, you can
  either click its number at the top, or the <i>current</i> button.</p>
<p class="extra">The difference between the two is that when <i>current</i> is
  selected, and you select a program in another bank from the Chroma's
  control panel, the <em>Programs</em> screen automatically switches to that
  bank. There is also a difference when you set up a
  {Linking_programs link}.</p>
<p>There are also some indicators that can appear in program buttons:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">{link2.png height=16} appears if
  the stored program contains a {_link_program link}, and shows what program it
  links to. A 1- or 2-digit number implicitly refers to the same bank; a
  3-digit number refers to a specific bank.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">{seq2.png height=16} appears if
  the stored program contains a {_sequence_program} parameter, and shows what
  program it refers to.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">{l.png height=16} means that the
  program is linked to by the currently selected program.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">{s.png height=16} means that the
  program is the "sequence program" of the current program, so it
  will be selected next if the sequence program footswitch is pressed.</p>
