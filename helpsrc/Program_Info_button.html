<p>This shows the number of the {_current_program} in the Digital Chroma, along
  with its name. If the program has no name, it says "(no name)".
  If it doesn't exist at all, it says "(scratch)", meaning
  that all parameters have their default
  values.</p>
<p>If the {_program} differs from its stored version, the text is shown in
  pink.</p>
<p class="extra">This happens as soon as you make any change to the program
  in the Editor screen, or from the Chroma's control panel. It can also
  happen if you independently modify the stored program of the same number in
  the Programs screen.</p>
<p>Clicking or {_tap tapping} this button reloads the program, discarding any
  unsaved changes.</p>
<p class="extra">If you do this by mistake, you can always click or tap

  with more choices.</p>
<h2>Hotkeys</h2>
