<h1>Tone controls</h1>
<p>Unlike the original Chroma, the tone controls are program parameters, so
  they can be used to voice the sound, rather than just compensate for the
  speakers. They are made more versatile by the addition of four panel
  parameters, Bass Frequency, Middle Frequency, Middle Resonance and Treble
  Frequency, making it a true three-band parametric equalizer. Since there is
  only one set of sliders, the A and B channel tone controls always operate in
  tandem. However, pressing SET SPLIT temporarily connects the tone control
  sliders to their frequency controls, and the TUNE slider to the middle
  resonance. After adjusting these, you can turn the SET SPLIT switch off by
  pressing it, or PROG SELECT, or PARAM SELECT.</p>
<p>The output of the tone controls goes though a simple distortion algorithm.
  It is controlled by a {_bipolar} Distortion parameter, providing primarily
  odd-order (symmetric) distortion for positive settings, and even-order
  (asymmetric) distortion for negative settings.</p>
