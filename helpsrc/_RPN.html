is a composite control made up of three or four Control Change messages,
providing access to a potentially huge number of parameters that are defined by
the MIDI Specification, and available in all instruments that choose to support
them. The Digital Chroma supports two of them, Pitch Bend Range, and MIDI
Polyphonic Expression (MPE), on input only.</p>
