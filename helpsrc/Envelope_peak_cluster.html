<h1>ENVELOPE peak cluster</h1>
<p>{envelope-peak-cluster.png width=373}</p>
<p>This sets how the peak amplitude of the envelope is affected by either
  {_velocity}, a {_lever} position, or a {_pedal} position. The
  {Envelope_peak_mod_select <i>mod select</i>} {_parameter} determines what
  controls the peak amplitude, and for velocity, what the shape of the response
  curve is. The {Envelope_peak_mod_depth <i>mod depth</i>} {_slider} determines
  how much the peak can vary. The small box contains a graph that shows the
  relationship of the velocity or other input value and the resulting peak. If
  the range is turned off, the peak is always one {_unit}. If the range is
  turned up, the peak can vary from zero to two units for the first seven
  selections, zero to one for the rest.</p>
