<h1>GLIDE shape</h1>
<p>These select one of four shapes for the {_glide} generators. Three of them
  produce "portamento", which is a smooth sliding from note to
  note; one produces "glissando", which is a chromatic scale from
  note to note.</p>

      amount of time, adjustable from 10ms to 15s, to get from one note to the

    <td/>
    <td><em>Exponential</em>: This slows down as it approaches the
      target pitch, and theoretically never quite gets there, so the time is
      actually a "time constant", the time it would have taken to
      get to the pitch if it hadn't slowed down. It is also adjustable
      from 10ms to 15s.</td>

  <tr>

    <td><em>Constant slope</em>: This changes with a certain number
      milliseconds per semitone, so it takes longer the further it has to go.
      It is adjustable from 40ms to 980ms per semitone.</td>
    <td>{glide-constant-slope.png width=128}</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td><em>Glissando</em>: This is just like the constant slope
      shape, but is quantized to semitones.</td>

<p>Glide normally only functions in monophonic
  {Common_keyboard_algorithm} and the poly ordered and poly
  buffered algorithms. However, it can also be enabled on the normal poly mode
  via the left {Common_footswitch_mode}. When the footswitch is
  pressed, voice assignment temporarily becomes monophonic, and glides from
  note to note.</p>
<p>Glide A always controls {_oscillator} A, and glide B always controls
  oscillator B, so to use glide one normally {_gang gangs} the
  {Glide_cluster glide clusters} together. When used elsewhere as a modulation
  source, middle C is zero, and 32 semitones equals one {_unit}, so the Digital
  Chroma's internal keyboard goes from \-1 to almost +1 unit.</p>
