<h1>Volume and tone</h1>
<p>The Digital Chroma uses the VOLUME slider as a performance control, rather
  than as a master volume control on the final output. Similarly, the tone
  controls are actual parameter controls that are stored as part of the
  program. You should use the volume and tone controls of your amplifier or
  mixer to compensate for the overall level or the sound of the speakers, and
  use the Chroma's controls for relative adjustments.</p>
<p>There is, however, a master volume control. If you press SET SPLIT, the
  VOLUME slider becomes a master volume control. It is set to maximum whenever
  the Digital Chroma is started.</p>
<p>Finally, there is an Analog Master {_global_parameter} which is described
  {Global_analog_master here}. It reduces the analog output relative to the
  digital output, to avoid clipping when driving low-impedance headphones.</p>
