<h1>COMMON keyboard algorithm</h1>
<p>This determines how key presses and releases are pre-processed, after the
  keyboard splitting but before the main or {_link_program link}
  {_instrument instruments} and MIDI output.</p>
<p>There are three polyphonic modes:</p>
<table class="vt">
  <tr>
    <td width="5%"/>
    <td width="15%">polyphonic</td>
    <td>For normal polyphonic playing. {_glide Glide} is normally disabled, but
      if the {Common_footswitch_mode} parameter assigns the
      left footswitch to the "glide" function, it can be
      conditionally enabled, although it effectively switches to mono single
      mode (see below) while it is enabled. This is the default.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td>poly ordered</td>
    <td>Whenever a new chord is played, the notes are assigned to voices in
      pitch order, from top to bottom, so that the voices will remain in the
      same pitch order when gliding from one chord to another. This involves
      delaying by an amount specified by the {_global_parameter global}
      <i>rollover time</i> parameter, to make sure the entire chord has been
      captured.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td>poly buffered</td>
    <td>Notes are not directly played, but are added to a buffer, and then
      played in pitch order, from top to bottom, when the left footswitch is
      pressed (irrespective of the footswitch mode parameter). The buffer is
      cleared whenever the number of held keys goes from zero to one.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
<p>There are five monophonic modes:</p>
<table class="vt">
  <tr>
    <td width="5%"/>
    <td width="15%">single</td>
    <td>Only one note is played at a time, and new notes reuse the same
      voice(s). New notes only retrigger the envelopes if no note was already
      held.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td>multiple</td>
    <td>Only one note is played at a time, and new notes reuse the same
      voice(s). New notes always only retrigger the envelopes.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td>first</td>
    <td>Only one note is played at a time, and only if no notes were previously
      held.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td>bottom</td>
    <td>Only one note is played at a time, and only the bottom note if a chord
      is played. When playing an ascending scale, new notes are only played if
      there is a gap between them, or at least less overlap than the time
      specified by the global <i>rollover time</i> parameter.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td>top</td>
    <td>Only one note is played at a time, and only the top note if a chord is
      played. When playing a descending scale, new notes are only played if
      there is a gap between them, or at least less overlap than the time
      specified by the global <i>rollover time</i> parameter.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
<p>There are four arpeggiation modes, which involve repeated playing of
  buffered notes. The buffer is cleared whenever the number of held keys goes
  from zero to one. The arpeggiation continues as long as at least one key is
  held, or the sustain footswitch is held. Once all keys are released, 
  releasing and pressing sustain can stop and restart the arpeggio. The
  patterns are:</p>
<table class="vt">
  <tr>
    <td width="5%"/>
    <td width="15%">up</td>
    <td>Ascending pitch order.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td>down</td>
    <td>Descending pitch order.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td>up/down</td>
    <td>Bidirectional, starting on the bottom note.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td>down/up</td>
    <td>Bidirectional, starting on the top note.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
<p>There are two sequence modes, which are similar to the arpeggiation modes
  except that they keep notes in the order they were played, rather than pitch
  order. This means that the same note can be added to the buffer more than
  once. The patterns are:</p>
<table class="vt">
  <tr>
    <td width="5%"/>
    <td width="15%">sequence</td>
    <td>In order of playing.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td>random</td>
    <td>In random order. Notes that have multiple copies in the buffer are
      played more often.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
<p>There are two strum modes. In this mode, the lowest or highest two notes of
  the keyboard are filtered out even before the keyboard split takes place, and
  used as triggers. They cause any other notes held on the keyboard to be
  replayed. Held notes are also added to a buffer, which isn't cleared
  until the next time the number of held notes goes from zero to one, and the
  trigger plays all released notes that are still in the buffer but with a very
  short duration, simulating strumming on damped strings. (The apparent
  duration of the short notes can be adjusted via its envelope release
  parameters.)</p>
<table class="vt">
  <tr>
    <td width="5%"/>
    <td width="15%">strum low</td>
    <td>The lowest two keys are used as the triggers.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td>strum high</td>
    <td>The highest two keys are used as the triggers.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
<p class="extra">If using the strum modes with an external keyboard, you should
  play the lowest and highest note of the keyboard once before the performance,
  so that the Digital Chroma will know the range of the keyboard. This
  isn't necessary on the internal keyboard.</p>
