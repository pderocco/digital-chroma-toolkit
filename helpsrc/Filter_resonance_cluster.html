<h1>FILTER resonance cluster</h1>
<p>{filter-resonance-cluster.png width=373}</p>
<p>This includes the {Filter_resonance <i>resonance</i>} {_slider}, which
  adjusts the amount of {_filter} {_resonance}, before modulation. Unlike the
  original Chroma, which only had eight fixed settings, this is continuously
  variable, and can be modulated. The highest three settings cause the filter
  to oscillate, with different degrees of overdrive, superimposing a sine wave
  on top of whatever signal is being filtered. The three {_button buttons}
  below the slider allow these choices to be made quickly.</p>
<p>The {Filter_resonance_mod_select <i>mod select</i>} buttons and
  {Filter_resonance_mod_depth <i>mod depth</i>} allow the resonance to be
  modulated.</p>
<p>An oscillating filter can play a normal scale if its {Filter_tune tuning}
  is set to C5 (middle C) and one of the {Filter_mod_cluster} mod inputs uses
  glide A or B as the mod select, with a depth of 32 semitones per unit.</p>
