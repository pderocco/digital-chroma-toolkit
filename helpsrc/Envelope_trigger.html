<h1>ENVELOPE trigger</h1>
<p>These control the delay time of each {_envelope Envelope 2} generator, up to
  over two seconds. The highest twelve settings instead allow it to be
  triggered by something other than the key press:</p>
<table class="vt">
  <tr>
    <td width="5%"/>
    <td width="15%">release</td>
    <td>The envelope is triggered when the key is released.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="5%"/>
    <td width="15%">release sustain</td>
    <td>The envelope is triggered when the key and sustain footswitch are
      released, whichever happens last.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td>mono multiple</td>
    <td>All voices share a common envelope computed by the virtual
      {_instrument}, and that envelope is retriggered on any key press.
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td>mono single</td>
    <td>All voices share a common envelope computed by the virtual
      {_instrument}, and that envelope is triggered when the number of held
      keys goes from zero to one. This can be useful for simulating the
      percussion envelope of a Hammond organ.
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td>envelope 1A\nenvelope 1B</td>
    <td>These trigger the envelope when either Envelope 1 starts its decay
      phase. Obviously, that is only useful if the Envelope 1 attack time is
      set to something other than "instant".
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td>sweep A\nsweep B</td>
    <td>These trigger the envelope at the start of each sweep cycle, and
      release it (unless the sustain footswitch is held) in the middle of the
      cycle.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td>\-sweep A\n\-sweep B</td>
    <td>These trigger the envelope in the middle of each sweep cycle, and
      release it (unless the sustain footswitch is held) at the start of the
      cycle.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td>\+sweep A\n\+sweep B</td>
    <td>These trigger the envelope at the start of each sweep cycle, and again
      in the middle.</td>
