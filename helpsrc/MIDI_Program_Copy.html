<h1>MIDI Program Copy</h1>
<p>NRPN 25,0 on the Editor input copies a program file into another location.
  The Bank MSB and Data MSB specify the destination, and the Bank LSB and Data
  LSB specify the source. This is echoed back to the editor.</p>
<p>If the source and destination both exist, the source overwrites the
  destination; if the source doesn't exist, the destination is deleted. If the
  source and destination are the same, nothing happens, but it is still
  echoed.</p>
