<h1>GLIDE section</h1>
<p>{glide-section.png width=384}</p>
<p>Each of the two "{_glide}" generators takes the note number and turns it
  into a control signal that varies an {_oscillator} frequency. <i>GLIDE A</i>
  always controls <i>OSCILLATOR A</i>, and <i>GLIDE B</i> always controls
  <i>OSCILLATOR B</i>, but either of them can also used for modulating anything
  else. The glide generators can also filter the changes in pitch, by applying
  portamento, which causes pitches to slide from note to note, or glissando,
  which causes them to go through chromatic steps from note to note.</p>
<p>Since there are only four {_parameter parameters} controlling the glide,
  each glide only has one {Glide_cluster glide} {_cluster}. The {_button} shows
  the current <i>shape</i> parameter, and the {_slider} controls the
  <i>time</i>. The cluster also contains a <i>mod select</i> and <i>mod
  depth</i> for modulating the time.</p>
