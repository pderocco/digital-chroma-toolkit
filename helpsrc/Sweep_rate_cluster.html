<h1>SWEEP rate cluster</h1>
<p>{sweep-rate-cluster.png width=373}</p>
<p>This contains {_parameter parameters} related to the {_sweep} synchonization
  and rate. The {Sweep_mode <i>mode</i>} parameter chooses between a
  per-{_voice} sweep or a common sweep in the virtual {_instrument}, and also
  determines whether the sweep is reset to the start of a cycle on a key
  press.</p>
<p>The {Sweep_rate <i>rate</i>} parameter is the basic rate before modulation.
  Slow rates are shown as cycle times in seconds, while faster rates are shown
  as frequencies in Hertz. The highest eight settings synchronize the sweep to
  received MIDI clocks (on any MIDI input port) with eight different possible
  ratios. These choices can be quickly selected with the {_button buttons}
  below the {_slider}; they disable rate modulation.</p>
<p>The {Sweep_rate_mod_select <i>mod select</i>} parameter chooses what to
  modulate the sweep rate with, and the {Sweep_rate_mod_depth <i>mod depth</i>}
  parameter determines how much the rate is varied.</p>
