<h1>The patch</h1>
<p>This one {_parameter} has probably the most dramatic effect on the sound of
  a {_voice}, because it controls how the sound processing modules are
  interconnected. You can see all the choices {Control_patch here}.</p>
<p>The first patch, called independent, is the most generally useful, because
  it treats the two {_channel channels} as separate synthesizers. The
  modulation sources can still be freely mixed between the two channels, but
  the sound of each channel basically goes from {_oscillator} to {_waveshaper}
  to {_filter} to {_amplifier} to pan to tone control to reverb to output.
  Since the Digital Chroma has four-pole filters, many four-pole sounds can
  still be accomplished in the independent patch, allowing the two oscillators
  to be panned to opposite sides and detuned slightly, for a rich, spacious
  sound.</p>
<p>The patch also controls special effects. These mimic the analog special
  effects (sync, ring mod and filter FM) of the original Chroma, but also add
  multiply. Ring mod replaces oscillator A's sound with the digital
  cross-product of the two oscillator's pulse outputs, while multiply
  replaces A's sound with the analog cross-product of the two
  oscillator's outputs, whatever wave shapes are selected. For the more
  technically minded, the ring mod effect is implemented with an exclusive-OR
  gate on the two pulse outputs, while the multiply just multiplies the two
  oscillator outputs. The two are equivalent only of both oscillators are set
  to produce square waves (Shape = pulse, Width = 50%). The multiply effect is
  generally cleaner because it produces only sum and difference frequencies,
  while the ring mod effect leaves some of the original harmonics intact. They
  produce sounds that are weird in different ways, so just choose between them
  by ear.</p>
<p>The sync effect was a standard effect in many early analog synthesizers,
  because it was easy to implement in hardware: when the A oscillator's
  sawtooth reset, it would force the B oscillator's sawtooth to reset as
  well. This guarantees the B oscillator to be locked to the A
  oscillator's pitch, but allows it to produce very rich harmonic spectra
  that change dramatically as the B oscillator's pitch control is
  varied. It can also be useful for ensuring that two oscillators that have the
  same frequency maintain a predictable phase relationship.<p>
<p>The filter FM effect uses the output of the B channel to modulate the A
  channel's filter frequency. This can be used for strange alien
  voice-like sounds, and is the basis for the "Oh, Yeah" program in
  the factory presets.</p>
