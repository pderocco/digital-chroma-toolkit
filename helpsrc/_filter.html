<p><em>filter:</em> A sound processing module that modifies the harmonic
structure of a sound. Each voice has two, and each one can be tuned to any
pitch and modulated by any {_control_signal control signals}. A filter can
emphasize those frequencies around the pitch it is tuned to by turning its
{_resonance} up, and usually attenuates frequencies above that point, but it
can also attentuate frequencies below that point as well. Finally, if the
resonance is turned all the way up, the filter becomes an oscillator,
superimposing a sine wave on top of whatever signal is fed through the
filter.</p>
<p><i>Also:</i> {_oscillator}, {_waveshaper}, {_amplifier}</p>
