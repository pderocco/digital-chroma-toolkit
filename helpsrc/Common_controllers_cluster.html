<h1>COMMON controllers cluster</h1>
<p>{common-controllers-cluster.png width=373}</p>
<p>This contains several {_parameter parameters} that select various input
  modes.</p>
<p>The <i>{Common_keyboard_algorithm}</i> has sixteen
  choices, including various polyphonic, monophonic, arpeggiated, sequenced,
  and strum algorithms. The default choice is the first one, the basic
  polyphonic mode.</p>
<p>The {Common_footswitch_mode} parameter is shown as two sets
  of {_button buttons}, one to enable or disable the sustain {_footswitch}, the
  other to choose from the various modes of the left footswitch.</p>
<p>The <i>{Common_ribbon_algorithm}</i> determines how the
  value generated by the optional {_ribbon} controller is affected by touching,
  sliding, and releasing.</p>
