<h1>User interface</h1>
<p>You already know that the panel is put into Program Select mode by pressing
  PROG SELECT, and into Parameter Select mode by pressing PARAM SELECT. In
  these modes, the number switches select two different things. And you know
  that pressing a bank number while holding PROG SELECT (or STORE, or one of
  the LINK switches) selects a bank, before selecting the {_program} within the
  bank. And you know that SET SPLIT followed by a number is used to select
  {_extended_parameter extended parameters},
  {_global_parameter global parameters}, or calibrations.</p>
