<h1>MIDI playback input</h1>
<p>The {_USB_device_port} is used to play back sequences from an external DAW.
  All 64 channels have their own {_player players}, and sending anything that
  was previously recorded back into the Digital Chroma results in a precise
  duplicate performance. {_NRPN NRPNs} that alter stored programs are not
  supported.</p>
<p>The only difference between this dialect and the {MIDI_record_output}
  dialect is that on input an {MIDI_Edit_Request} message is recognized.</p>
