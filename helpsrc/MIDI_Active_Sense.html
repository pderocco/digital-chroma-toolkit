<h1>MIDI Active Sense</h1>
<p>MIDI defines the byte 254 as an Active Sense byte, which does nothing but
  indicate to the receiver that the sender is still alive and connected. The
  Digital Chroma transmits Active Sensing bytes on all MIDI ports or virtual
  jacks whenever 200ms has elapsed since the last output on that port. When
  the output is busy with real messages, no Active Sense bytes are necessary,
  but when the real messages stop, Active Sense bytes are sent instead.</p>
<p>If the Digital Chroma ever receives an Active Sense byte on a particular
  port or virtual jack, it assumes from then on that whatever it is connected
  to will not allow its output to go idle for more than 300ms. If 300ms
  elapses without any further messages, the Digital Chroma acts as though a
  Reset had been received on that port. It won't do this again until
  another Active Sense byte has been received.</p>
