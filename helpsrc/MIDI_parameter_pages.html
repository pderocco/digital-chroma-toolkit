<h1>MIDI parameter pages</h1>
<p>Since a Chroma program has more than 128 parameters, they are divided into
  three pages:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Page 0 contains all the common parameters, which are not directly
    sound-related, plus any non-channelized sound parameters.</li>
  <li>Page 1 contains all the A channel parameters in a Chroma program.</li>
  <li>Page 2 contains all the B channel parameters in a Chroma program.</li>
  </ul>
<p>Within each page, parameters are numbered contiguously starting at zero.</p>
<p>{_global_parameter Global parameters} are presented in page 15. They are
  numbered starting at one, since their MIDI numbers match the panel switch
  numbers used to select them.</p>
