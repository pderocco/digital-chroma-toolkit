<h1>AMPLIFIER mod cluster</h1>
<p>{amplifier-mod-cluster.png width=373}</p>
<p>The <i>AMPLIFIER</i> section has two of these for each {_channel}, called
  <i>mod 1</i> and <i>mod 2</i>. Each one contains a
  {Amplifier_mod_select <i>mod select</i>} {_parameter} that chooses a
  modulation source, and a {Amplifier_mod_depth <i>mod depth</i>} parameter
  that adjusts its level. The two modulations are added together, and then
  multiplied by the {Amplifier_post_mod_cluster <i>post mod</i>} value.</p>
<p>The <i>mod select</i> parameter can select any {_envelope}. The default is
  envelope 1A for <i>mod 1</i>, envelope 1B for <i>mod 2</i>. You can also
  choose a fixed 1-unit value, which is only useful in the B channel, when the
  {Control_patch_cluster <i>patch</i>} parameter uses the B amplifier to
  control the mix of the B oscillator with the A oscillator. If you use it on
  an amplifier that is connected to the output, the note will never turn off,
  which is likely not what you want. But in the original Chroma, you
  couldn't set the mix of the B oscillator without wasting an envelope
  generator.</p>
<p>The mod depth is shown in decibels, and has a range from off to +6db above
  the nominal level. The default value for mod 1 is 0db, and the default for
  mod 2 is off. However, the mod 1 sliders have a "significant"
  value of off, and the mod 2 sliders have a "significant" value of
  0db, which you can quickly set by tapping.</p>
