<h1>Set Split functions</h1>
<p>The SET SPLIT switch is used to set the keyboard split point, but is also
  used as a general prefix switch for accessing secondary functions. When it
  is pressed, its LED begins to flash, indicating it is waiting for a key or
  switch to be pressed. Pressing a key sets the split point, pressing SET SPLIT
  again sets the split to the same place it was last set, pressing a number
  selects an extended parameter, global parameter or calibration, and PROG
  SELECT and PARAM SELECT abort the operation.<p>
<p>While SET SPLIT is flashing, the five sliders at the left end of the panel
  are connected to different {_parameter parameters}. The three tone sliders
  are connected to the frequencies, rather than the levels for those tone
  controls, the TUNE slider adjusts the middle tone control's resonance,
  and the VOLUME slider adjusts the instrument's master volume. Once any
  slider is moved, the SET SPLIT function will no longer set the split point if
  you press a key, so you can play the instrument to listen to the sound of the
  changes you're making. You can exit this mode by pressing SET SPLIT
  again, as well as PROG SELECT or PARAM SELECT.</p>
<p>There are additional SET SPLIT functions that don't really fit into
  any other categories, but you can find them listed in the reference section
  {All_switch_functions here}.</p>
