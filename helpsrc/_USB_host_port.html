<p><em>USB host port:</em> Either of the two USB type A connectors on the
Digital Chroma's rear panel. They can be used for flash drives, for
access using the various LOAD and SAVE buttons on the control panel, or for
MIDI input from external keyboards, pedalboards, or controllers. When used for
MIDI, the upper one is called "HostA" and the bottom
"HostB". The {_global_parameter global}
{Global_midi_main_in MIDI Main Input} {_parameter} selects one channel on
either port for merging in with the internal keyboard and
{_performance_control performance controls}, and the
{Global_midi_link_in MIDI Link Input} parameter selects another channel that
can be used for independent input when the {Common_link_mode} parameter is set
either to "external" or "internal".</p>
