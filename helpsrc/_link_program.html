<p><em>Link:</em> In a Digital Chroma {_program}, a set of
{_parameter parameters} that refer to a second program that is played in
parallel with the main program. Selecting a program creates an {_instrument}
to play the main program, and if the Link Mode parameter isn't set to No
Link, creates a second instrument to play the link program. They can be
layered, or the keyboard can be split, or one can be played by an external
keyboard or pedalboard via MIDI.</p>
