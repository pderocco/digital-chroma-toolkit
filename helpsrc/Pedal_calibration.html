<h1>Pedal calibration</h1>
<p>The variable pedals suffer from the same tolerances as the levers, so they
  can need calibration as well. Furthermore, the pedals aren't
  permanently built into the Chroma, so you will need to calibrate once for
  your own pedals, and recalibrate again if you ever change them. Since the
  pedals are separate, calibration 27 applies to pedal 1, and calibration 28
  applies to pedal 2. Since there is no midpoint that needs calibration, you
  can start the calibration with the pedal in any position, but it is still
  necessary to move the pedal through its entire range. As with the lever
  calibration, the display shows the pedal voltage, on an arbitrary 0 to 1000
  scale. It is normal for this to go all the way to zero, but it is okay if it
  doesn't; that's what the calibration corrects for.</p>
<p>Since different pedals (even ones that look identical) will produce
  somewhat different voltage ranges, if you have both pedals, you should
  always assign them to the same inputs. If they are the same type, you should
  put a piece of tape on one of the plugs, to remember which one is pedal 1.
  Otherwise, according to Murphy's Law, you'll have a 60% chance
  of having miscalibrated pedals whenever you set up.</p>
