<h1>Sweep generator</h1>
<p>Each {_sweep} generator generates a repeating control signal pattern, at a
  rate that is adjustable from one cycle every ten seconds up to thirty cycles
  per second. The Mode parameter gives choices of several different things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In the poly modes, each {_voice} has its own sweep generator. In the mono
    modes, the {_instrument} generates a common sweep phase for all voices,
    although amplitude control is still per-voice.</li>
  <li>Normally, the sweep generators free-run, but they can also be
    synchronized to the key press, so that they start at phase zero at the
    start of each note. In the mono modes, the sweep can be synced either to
    any key press, or to the first key of a chord or legato passage.</li>
  <li>Whether free-running or key synced, the rate can also be slaved to
    received MIDI clocks, with eight different ratios. The highest eight
    {Sweep_rate Sweep Rate} parameter values choose the ratio.</li>
  </ul>
<p>Of course, these things are all independent for the A {_channel} and B
  channel sweep generators.</p>
<p>The sorts of shapes that the sweep can produce include the usual {_bipolar}
  sine wave, and a {_unipolar} square wave for trill effects. You're
  given a choice between sine and cosine, but this is only meaningful if
  synchronized to key presses. There is also an offset sine and a half sine,
  both of which are unipolar, and there is a triangle shape and a sawtooth
  shape. Finally, there are a set of patterns that step at twice the sweep
  rate, including a completely random pattern.</p>
<p>Both the sweep rate and sweep amplitude can be modulated by other things. In
  most cases, the amplitude will be modulated either by the left {_lever} or by
  a delay envelope generator built into the sweep generator. Useful rate
  modulations include Random, to make all voices' sweep generators run at
  slightly different rates, and Pitch, to make the rate vary across the
  keyboard.</p>
