<h1>Selecting sounds</h1>
<p>The instrument starts up with the PROG SELECT switch lit up in the PANEL
  MODE section. This means that the numbered switches in the right section of
  the panel select different sound {_program programs}. You can press any of
  the fifty switches to select different sounds in bank 1 (programs 101 through
  150). To try programs in other banks, you can hold PROG SELECT like a shift
  key and press 1 through 9 to select the bank, and then press one of the fifty
  switches to select a program within that bank. The new bank will remain
  selected until you explicitly switch to a different bank.</p>
<p>As shipped, bank 1 contains a family of sounds designed expressly for the
  Digital Chroma, and banks 5 through 9 contain translations of the original
  Chroma's five sets of factory sounds. Banks 2 through 4 are empty, so
  selecting any sound in those banks will result in a raw sawtooth
  "scratch" sound.</p>
