<h1>OSCILLATOR section</h1>
<p>{oscillator-section.png width=520}</p>
<p>The {_oscillator oscillators} generate audio frequencies, whose pitches are
  controlled by {_glide} generators, and whose shapes are generated by
  {_waveshaper waveshapers}. <i>OSCILLATOR A</i> is always controlled by
  <i>GLIDE A</i>, and its shape is produced by <i>WAVESHAPER A</i>, and the B
  side is similarly chained together. Each oscillator has the following
  {_parameter} {_cluster clusters}:</p>
<ul>
  <li>One {Oscillator_tune_cluster tune} cluster. All it has is one basic tune
    {_slider}.</li>
  <li>Five {Oscillator_mod_cluster mod} clusters. Each {_cluster_button} shows
    the current <i>mod select</i> parameter, and the slider controls the <i>mod
    depth</i>. The first modulation cluster also has a
    {Oscillator_mod1_cluster steps} parameter, for sampling or quantizing.</li>
  </ul>
