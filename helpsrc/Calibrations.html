<h1>Calibrations</h1>
<p>These are similar to {_global_parameter global parameters}, except that
  those are simple numeric values that can be changed at any time with the
  {_parameter_control} or from the {Global_parameters} section of the
  Toolkit's {Tools_screen}, while calibrations are more complex,
  requiring additional steps, and can only be performed from the Digital
  Chroma's control panel.</p>
<p>Calibration mode is entered from {_program_select_mode} by pressing
  SET SPLIT and one of the numbered switches in the bottom row. Once in this
  mode, the SET SPLIT and STORE LEDs both flash, indicating that either may be
  pressed to exit calibration mode, and that different calibrations can be
  selected merely by pressing their numbers. Pressing STORE records any changed
  calibrations, while SET SPLIT discards any changes and restores whatever
  conditions were in effect before going into calibration mode.</p>
<p>The numbered switches and their calibrations include:</p>
