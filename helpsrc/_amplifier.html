<p><em>amplifier:</em> A sound processing module within a {_voice} that
controls the volume. Each voice has two, one in each {_channel}. Each
amplifier's volume is controlled by the sum of two envelope mod inputs,
multiplied by a post mod input typically used for a pedal or a {_sweep}
tremolo.</p>
<p>An amplifier is usually used at the output of the voice, in which case it
also includes a pan control that can be modulated. But the B channel amplifier
is used in certain {_patch patches} to control the mix of the A and B
{_oscillator oscillators}, in which case the pan portion is disabled.</p>
<p><i>Also:</i> {_oscillator}, {_waveshaper}, {_filter}</p>
