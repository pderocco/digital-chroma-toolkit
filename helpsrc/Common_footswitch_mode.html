<h1>COMMON footswitch mode</h1>
<p>This sets the operational modes of the two {_footswitch footswitches}. The
  right (sustain) footswitch can be either enabled or displayed, and the left
  footswitch can be placed in the following modes:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="5%"/>
    <td width="15%">none</td>
    <td>Disabled.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td>latch</td>
    <td>Similar to the function of a piano's middle pedal (sostenuto).
      Pressing the footswitch latches all currently sounding notes, whether
      they are held via their keys or via the sustain footswitch.
      {_selective Selective} controls are also frozen. While they are latched,
      other notes, or even the same notes, can be independently played over the
      latched notes. When the footswitch is released, the notes are released,
      even if their keys are still held, although they can continue to be
      sustained by the sustain footswitch.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td>gate</td>
    <td>Keys only trigger notes if the footswitch is held.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td>\-gate</td>
    <td>Keys only trigger notes if the footswitch is released.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td>glide</td>
    <td>Keyboard algorithms that normally support glide disable the glide if
      the footswitch is released. Keyboard algorithms that normally don't 
      support glide switch to a mono mode and enable glide when the footswitch
      is pressed.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td>\-glide</td>
    <td>Keyboard algorithms that normally support glide disable the glide if

      support glide switch to a mono mode and enable glide when the footswitch
      is released.</td>

<p>Some of these modes are primarily useful when combined with a link sound
  that uses a different mode.</p>

<h2>Toolkit</h2>
<p>These are presented as two separate parameters in the
  {Common_controllers_cluster controllers cluster} within the
  {Common_section}.</p>

<h2>Chroma panel</h2>
<p>This is contained in the <i>CONTROL</i> section of the right panel, under
  the following parameter number:</p>
