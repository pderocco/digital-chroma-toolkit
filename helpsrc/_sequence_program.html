<p><em>sequence program:</em> A {_parameter} that refers to the number of a
{_program} that should be selected when the SEQUENCE PROGRAM {_footswitch} is
tapped. This allows a sequence of programs to be set up in advance, and stepped
through easily in performance. In the Digital Chroma, it is set by holding the
footswitch and selecting the program while it is held. In the Toolkit, it is
set by {_long-press long-pressing} the target program {_button} in the Programs
{_screen}, and {_tap tapping} the "sequence" button.</p>
<p>The {_default_value} of the parameter is <i>previous</i>, which reloads
whatever program was selected (including any unsaved edits) before the current
one. This program can always be stepped to by long-pressing the footswitch,
which provides a way to recover if the footswitch is tapped accidentally.</p>
