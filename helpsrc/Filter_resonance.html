<h1>FILTER resonance</h1>
<p>These control the basic {_resonance} of each {_filter} before modulation.
  The values are shown as the mathematical "Q" values, ranging from
  0.5 to 200. There are also three more settings at the high end of the scale
  that have an infinite Q, which causes the filter to oscillate, superimposing
  a sine wave on top of whatever signal is going into the filter, with three
  different levels of overdrive.</p>

<h2>Toolkit</h2>
<p>These are contained in the
  {Filter_resonance_cluster Filter resonance clusters} within the
  {Filter_section}.</p>

<h2>Chroma panel</h2>
<p>These are contained in the <i>CUTOFF</i> section of the right panel, under
  the following parameter number:</p>
<table class="p0">
  <tr>
    <td width="10%"/>
    <td>{sw-38.png height=48}</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
<p>These appear in the display as Resonance.</p>

<h2>MIDI</h2>
<p>These are accessed via the following {_NRPN NRPNs}:</p>
<table class="p0">
  <tr>
    <td width="6%"/>
    <td width="4%">A</td>
    <td>1,55</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td>B</td>
    <td>2,55</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

<h2>Values</h2>
<p>The values are displayed as Q values, except for the top three values which
  cause self-oscillation:</p>
