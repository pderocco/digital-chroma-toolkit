<p><em>timestamp:</em> A record of when a {_program} was created or most
recently modified. Timestamps are recorded in Universal time, unaffected by
timezone or daylight saving time, and have 100\usec resolution. The primary
purpose of timestamps is to be able to tell if two programs are the same,
without comparing all the parameters, but the coarser part of this information
is often useful to the user as well. Timestamps can be viewed in the Current
Program {_popup} accessible by {_long-press long-pressing} the
{_Program_Info_button} in the {_Navigation_bar}, or in the Program popup
accessible by long-pressing a {_program} button in the Programs {_screen}.
They are always displayed in the computer's current timezone.</p>
