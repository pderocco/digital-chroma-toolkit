<p><em>player:</em> A software module in the Digital Chroma that plays notes on
a virtual {_instrument}. The keyboard is connected to two players, one for the
main sound and the other for a {_link_program link} sound. There are also 64
players, one for each MIDI channel on the {_USB_device_port}, that are intended
for sequence playback, when connected to a DAW.</p>
<p>When a {_program} is selected, the player creates a new "active"
instrument, and sends all subsequent notes to it, but the previous instrument,
now "inactive", continues to exist as long as any if its notes are
held. {_parameter Parameter} changes are sent to the active instrument, so have
no effect on inactive instruments. However, the player is where the
{_performance_control} values are recorded, so they apply to both active and
inactive instruments.</p>
