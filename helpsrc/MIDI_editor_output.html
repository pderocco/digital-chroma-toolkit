<h1>MIDI editor output</h1>
<p>If an editor (e.g., the Toolkit) is connected, everything you do to the Main
  program, such as changing parameters or selecting a new program, is reported
  to the editor, so that it can update its display of the program. Similarly,
  everything you do to stored programs is also reported, so that the editor
  can update its record of what programs exist. This includes loading programs
  from an external drive, or even modifying program files over the network.
  Even operations initiated via the editor input are echoed back to it. Notes
  and controls are never sent to the editor. If the editor channel conflicts
  with record output, the editor takes precedence.</p>
