<h1>Rearranging programs</h1>
<p>{_program Programs} can be moved around in the <em>Programs</em> screen
  simply by {_drag dragging} them.</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you drag a program onto an empty button, it is moved there.</li>
  <li>If you drag a program onto another program, the two programs are
    swapped.</li>
  <li>If you drag an empty button onto a program, the program moves to the
    empty location.</li>
  </ul>
<p>If you want to <i>copy</i> a program, you {_tap} its button to select it,
  then {_long-press} the target location, and tap "store" in the
  {_popup}.</p>
<h2>Moving between banks</h2>
<p>If you want to move programs between banks, long-press the other bank number
  at the top of the screen. That number is highlighted in blue, and the screen
  is split between the two banks, so you can drag programs from one to the
  other. Naturally, you can select programs in the second bank, too, or
  long-press them to see the {Program_popup}.
<p>In this state, tapping bank numbers changes the upper bank, and
  long-pressing bank numbers changes the lower bank. To exchange the position
  of the two banks, tap the blue bank button. To revert to a single bank, tap
  the white bank button.</p>
