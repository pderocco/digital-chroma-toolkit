<p><em>NRPN:</em> In MIDI, a "Non-Registered Parameter Number",
which is a composite control made up of three or four Control Change messages,
providing access to a potentially huge number of parameters that are defined by
an instrument's manufacturer and specific to an instrument. The Digital
Chroma uses NRPNs to access {_parameter parameters}, perform {_program}
operations, and invoke miscellaneous functions when communicating with the
Toolkit.</p>
<p><i>Also:</i> {_RPN}, {_Sysex}</p>
