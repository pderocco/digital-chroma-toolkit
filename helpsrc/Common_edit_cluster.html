<h1>COMMON edit cluster</h1>
<p>{common-edit-cluster.png width=373}</p>
<p>This shows the {Common_edit_number edit <i>parameter</i>} and
  {Common_edit_mode edit <i>mode</i>} {_parameter parameters}. The former is
  the parameter to which the Digital Chroma's {_parameter_control} is
  connected. The latter is whether it affects the A {_channel} of a channelized
  parameter, the B channel, or both in parallel.<p>
<p>The <i>parameter</i> button shows the parameter number the way it is shown
  in the Digital Chroma's display, as P and a number for a regular
  parameter, or X and a number for an {_extended_parameter}. This is most
  easily changed from the Digital Chroma's control panel by going into
  {_parameter_select_mode PARAM SELECT} mode and then pressing a numbered
  switch. It can also be set in the Toolkit by first manipulating the parameter
  on the main screen or in one of the {_popup cluster popups}, then displaying
  this cluster and tapping the <i>parameter</i> button. It can also be reset to
  its default, which is "P1: patch" by {_long-press long-pressing}
  it. And of course, you can change the <i>mode</i> with the three smaller
  buttons.</p>
