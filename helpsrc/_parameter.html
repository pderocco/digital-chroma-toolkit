<p><em>parameter:</em> A numeric value that is part of a {_program}, that
controls some single aspect of a sound. Every parameter has a name, a range of
internal numeric values which are used over MIDI, a default value in a
{_scratch_program}, and a more user-friendly representation of each possible
numeric value. For instance, an oscillator pitch is shown using note symbols
like "G#4", while a modulation selector value is shown as the name
of the modulation source, like "envelope 2A".</p>
<p>Parameters are categorized as {_selector_parameter selector parameters},
which have distinct settings, and {_variable_parameter variable parameters},
which represent a continuous range of values with a certain resolution. On the
Digital Chroma, parameters are also categorized as "regular", if
they were included in the original Chroma, or
"{_extended_parameter extended}", if they are new.</p>
