<h1>Chroma number</h1>
<p>When you connect the Digital Chroma to a computer via either USB or a
  network, it normally presents itself as a device named "Chroma1"
  (possibly displayed in upper case). If you ever need to connect multiple
  Digital Chromas to the same computer, or use them on the same network, you
  can use calibration 41 and the parameter slider to change the final digit to
  anything from 1 to 9. When STORE is pressed to exit calibration mode, the
  Chroma will disconnect (from both USB and the network) and then reconnect a
  second or so later under the new name.</p>
<p>This setting also controls the name of the external drive folder that is
  accessed by the LOAD ONE through SAVE ALL switches.</p>
