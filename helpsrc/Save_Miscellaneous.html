<h1>Save Miscellaneous</h1>
<p>Pressing SET SPLIT, SAVE ONE is the inverse of {Load_Miscellaneous}. Unlike
  saving programs, a file that doesn't exist in the Chroma doesn't
  cause the corresponding file to be deleted from the external drive. It
  includes an additional pair of files not supported by Load Miscellaneous:</p>
<table class="vt">
  <tr>
    <td width="5%"/>
    <td width="20%">error logs</td>
    <td width="15%"><code>errlog.txt</code></td>
    <td>A log of various non-fatal errors that have been detected since the
      Chroma sound generation firmware (the <code>chroma</code> file) was
      started. This may include things like syntax errors in the program files,
      if they came from an external source.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td/>
    <td><code>errlog.bak</code></td>
    <td>The log from the previous run.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
