<h1>AMPLIFIER section</h1>
<p>{amplifier-section.png width=520}</p>
<p>An {_amplifier} controls the volume of a sound. The volume is controlled by
  up to two {_envelope} generators which are added together, and then
  multiplied by a third post modulation such as a {_pedal} or {_sweep} signal.
  If connected to the output, it also provides a panning control, which can be
  modulated. In some settings of the {_patch} {_parameter}, the <i>B</i>
  amplifier controls the mix between the <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> oscillators, and
  only the <i>A</i> amplifier goes to the output, so the <i>B</i> pan controls
  are inactive.</p>
<p>Each amplifier has four {_cluster clusters}:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Two envelope {Amplifier_mod_cluster mod} clusters, which are mixed
    together.</li>
  <li>One {Amplifier_post_mod_cluster post mod} cluster, which applies after
    the envelopes.</li>
  <li>One {Amplifier_pan_cluster pan} cluster</li>
  </ul>
