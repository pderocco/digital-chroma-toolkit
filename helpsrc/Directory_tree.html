    <td>The main sound generation firmware can be upgraded by replacing this
      with a new file. It is used when the system is restarted, which can be
      done by pressing SET SPLIT, 50.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td>panel.bak, panel.bin</td>
    <td>Usually only the .bak file exists. New panel firmware is installed by
      providing a new .bin file, which is renamed over the .bak file as soon as
      the system is restarted, and the firmware has been installed.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td>errlog.bak, errlog.txt</td>
    <td>These are the previous and current error log files. The .bak file could
      be useful if something caused the system to crash or otherwise freeze
      up.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td>exec</td>
    <td>This normally doesn't exist, but it provides a means to get the
      Linux operating system to do something internally, when diagnosing a
      failure. It is otherwise undocumented.</td>

    <td>cal.ini</td>
    <td>This is updated whenever one of the {Calibrations calibration}
      functions is performed.</td>

  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td>config.ini</td>
    <td>This normally doesn't exist, but it provides a means to tweak
      certain internal parameters. It isn't documented because it should
      never be necessary.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td>globals.ini</td>
    <td>This contains global parameters, and is updated a second after any of
      them are changed.</td>

    <td>These four files contain reverb parameters. Their meanings are
      undocumented.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td>devchg</td>
    <td>This dummy file is created or modified whenever a MIDI device is
      connected to one of the USB host ports. This event is monitored by the
      main sound generation firmware.</td>
