<h1>Selecting programs</h1>
<p>Selecting a {_program} to play it is as simple as {_tap tapping} a program
  {_button}. The button turns pale green, to indicate that it is now the
  {_current_program}. If you edit the program, this button turns pink, to
  remind you that you might want to store the change.</p>
<p>If the program is {_link_program linked} to another program in the same
  bank, an {l.png height=16} indicator appears on that other
  program. Similarly, if the program's "sequence program"
  parameter refers to another program in the same bank, an
  {s.png height=16} indicator appears on that other
  program.</p>
<p>To select a program in a different bank, tap the bank number button at the
  top to see that bank, and then tap the desired program in that bank. When you
  do so, the highlighted bank switches from the new bank number to the
  <i>current</i> button, indicating that the bank contains the currently
  selected program.</p>
<p>If you tap a gray program button, you get a "scratch" program,
  in which all parameters have their default values. The button is highlighted
  in pale yellow, but turns pink if you begin to edit the program.</p>
