<h1>Preprocessing</h1>
<p>Certain aspects of the Digital Chroma note and control processing are
  performed before the {_player players}, so that the {MIDI_record_output} can
  reflect the results of this processing. This includes the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Main and {_link_program Link} layering or keyboard splitting,
    including the keyboard split point.</li>
  <li>The Main and Link octave transpositions.</li>
  <li>The Link Balance, Spread and Detune {_parameter parameters}.</li>
  <li>The Keyboard Algorithms in both the Main and Link programs, including
    {_arpeggiation}.</p>
  <li>Those aspects of the Footswitch Mode parameter, in both the Main and Link
    programs, that affect the sounding of the notes, or the enabling or
    reinterpretation of the {_footswitch footswitches}.</li>
  <li>The translation of raw {_ribbon} controller values according to the
    Ribbon Algorithm parameters, in both the Main and Link programs.</li>
  </ul>
<p>The preprocessing is controlled by the relevant parameters in the Main and
  Link players. The reason certain parts of the performance processing is
  performed prior to the where the Main and Link channels are output to the
  {_USB_device_port} for recording is so that sequences will contain the actual
  notes heard, and not the keys pressed. Note that this means that the players
  connected to the 64 USB device port channels don't do any of this
  processing (e.g., arpeggiation), because they assume that what is being
  played into them is already the result of this processing.</p>
