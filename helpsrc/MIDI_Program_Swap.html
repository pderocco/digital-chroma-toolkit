<h1>MIDI Program Swap</h1>
<p>NRPN 27,0 on the Editor input swaps two program files. The Bank MSB and Data
  MSB specify one program, and the Bank LSB and Data LSB specify the other.
  Swapping a file with a non-existing file is equivalent to moving it. This is
  echoed back to the editor. Swapping a file with itself does nothing, but is
  still echoed.</p>
