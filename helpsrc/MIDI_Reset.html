<h1>MIDI Reset</h1>
<p>MIDI defines the byte 255 as a Reset byte. If the Digital Chroma receives
  this on any port or virtual jack, it treats it as though an All Sounds Off
  control and an All Controls Off control were received on all sixteen
  channels. This turns off all notes, and resets all performance controls to
  their default values. It also turns off MPE mode on the USB host and serial
  MIDI input ports.</p>
<p>If Reset is received on the serial or USB host ports, and an input is
  intercepted by the {_global_parameter global} MIDI Main Input or MIDI Link
  Input parameter, then the Reset is passed on through to the Main and Link
  {_player players}, but followed with additional messages that set the various
  controls according to the actual positions of the physical controls. This
  includes the two Reverb Room and Reverb Send controls, which come from the
  global Reverb Room and Reverb Send parameters.</p>
