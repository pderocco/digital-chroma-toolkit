<p><em>pedal:</em> One of the two variable pedals that can be plugged into the
  Digital Chroma. They are general-purpose controllers that can be used to
  modulate anything, although Pedal 1 is conventionally used for volume and
  Pedal 2 is used for other things.</p>
<p>Note that the Digital Chroma supports custom {_bipolar} pedals. With such a
  pedal, the normal "pedal" modulation sources only reflect the
  positive side of the pedal. To access the full bipolar range, use one of the
  "\+pedal" choices; to access just the negative side, use
  one of the "\-pedal" choices.</p>
<p>The Digital Chroma documentation refers to the switched controls like
  Sustain as "{_footswitch footswitches}" to avoid confusion.</p>
