<h1>Modulation units</h1>
<p>To have a sense of how the numeric values of {_parameter parameters} relate
  to their effects on the sound, you must understand the concept of a
  "unit". All control signals are measured in units, and the
  scaling of control inputs is documented in terms of these units. Control
  inputs are scaled as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>When related to pitch, one unit equals 32 semitones. Since the keyboard
    has 64 keys, middle C is considered to have a value of zero, and the
    keyboard ranges from \-1 unit to almost +1 unit. Transposition shifts
    this by <sup>12</sup>/<sub>32</sub>, or <sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub> of a unit
    either way.</li>
  <li>The key velocity has a 0-to-1 unit range, with <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>
    unit being a moderate strike.</li>
  <li>The {_lever levers} have a bipolar \+1 unit range. A
    {_global_parameter} determines whether pushing or pulling produces a
    positive value.</li>
  <li>When the two sides of a lever's range are used separately, each
    side has a 0-to-1 unit range, regardless of whether it is being pulled or
    pushed.</li>
  <li>The variable {_pedal pedals} have a 0-to-1 unit range, heel to toe.</li>
  </ul>
<p>Control signal generators use units as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The {_glide} output is scaled just like the keyboard.</li>
  <li>The {_sweep} generator output always has a maximum value of one unit, but
    bipolar shapes have a \+1 unit range, while unipolar waves are 0-to-1
    unit. Patterns may various minimum values. For the complete list, go
    {Sweep_shape here}.</li>
  <li>The {_envelope} peak value is one unit if not touch sensitive, 0 to 2
    units if touch sensitive, and 0 to 1 unit if controlled by something other
    than velocity. The default mapping of velocity to envelope peak is linear
    (doubling the velocity), but the value for moderate strikes can be
    increased or decreased by warping the shape, and the entire range can be
    squeezed symmetrically around one unit (e.g., going from 0.5 to 1.5
    units).</li>
  </ul>
<p>Control inputs on the sound modules are scaled as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Most modulatable inputs have a four-unit total range. For {_oscillator}
    pitch and {_filter} tuning, this represents 128 semitones. For pulse width
    (or saws phase), this represents 0% to 100%. For FM modulation index, this
    represents 0 to \+16 cycles of phase modulation. For panning, this
    represents full left to full right.</li>
  <li>Volume, on the other hand, has a two-unit total range, from off to 6db
    above nominal.</li>
  <li>The basic scaling of a pitch input is such that the modulation depth
    indicates the number of semitones per unit. For instance, if you crank the
    filter resonance up to maximum so that it self-oscillates, it would track
    the keyboard if one modulation select input were set to Glide A or Glide B
    and the corresponding depth were set to 32.</li>
  </ul>
<p>The scaling of secondary modulations, like the envelope decay time
  modulation depth, is expressed in the percentage of the controlled
  parameter's range covered by one unit of modulation. For instance, if
  a pedal, which has a 0-to-1 unit range, is used to modulate sweep rate, and
  the depth is set to 20%, the pedal will cover 20% of the sweep rate's
  range.</p>
