<h1>MIDI Edit Request</h1>
<p>NRPN 113,0 on any MIDI input channel instructs the Digital Chroma to open or
  close the Editor channel. If the Data MSB is zero, it closes the Editor
  channel without acknowledgment, even if it is a different channel. If the
  Data MSB is nonzero, it makes the channel it was received on the Editor
  channel, and sends back {MIDI_Edit_Response} NRPN 49,0 on that channel.</p>
<p class="extra">Note that the serial MIDI port is too slow to be used
  effectively by an external editor.</p>
<p>The Digital Chroma assumes the editor maintains a copy of the
  {_parameter parameters}, {_timestamp}, and metadata of the program in the
  Main {_instrument}, as well as the timestamp, metadata, and link and sequence
  parameters of all the stored parameters. It is up to the editor to request
  this information after opening the Editor channel, but the Digital Chroma
  always transmits messages to the editor whenever something is done in the
  Main program or any stored program, even if those changes were done in
  response to commands form the editor. This includes parameter changes,
  program operations, and Undo/Redo status changes. It does not include notes
  played, or control changes.</p>
