<h1>Clock setting</h1>
<p>If the clock is a little off, then you should adjust the clock itself. The
  easiest way is with the Digital Chroma Toolkit, by clicking the clock at the
  top of the {Navigation_bar}, but if you're not connected to a computer, you
  can do it with calibration 37. This reads the current time, and puts it into
  the Chroma's display, but without incrementing it every second. Instead,
  moving the {_parameter_control} into the upper half of the range causes the
  time to increment at varying speeds, and moving it into the lower half causes
  it to decrement at varying speeds. When the time is set properly, recenter
  the slider to freeze the value. The setting is written into the clock when
  all the calibrations are saved and calibration mode is exited by pressing
  STORE. Typically, one would adjust the clock to the next minute, then press
  the STORE button when some other known accurate clock indicates that that
  minute has arrived.</p>
<p>If the Digital Chroma is ever connected to a network with access to the
  internet, it will read the correct time from an internet time server. This
  calibration should not be necessary unless you never connect to a
  network.</p>
