<p><em>gang:</em> In the Toolkit, to tie two {_cluster clusters} together so
that one set of controls operates both in parallel. The only clusters that can
be ganged are those A and B clusters that are adjacent to each other. They are
ganged by {_drag dragging} one cluster button onto its twin, which copies its
parameters. The B channel cluster controls are replaced with a large button
with an equals sign, which can be {_tap tapped} to ungang the clusters.</p>
