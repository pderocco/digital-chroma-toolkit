<h1>Quick-Start</h1>
<p>The Toolkit user interface is designed to work with touch, but you can use a
  mouse's left button as well. The basic gestures are tapping (or
  clicking), long-pressing (for more than a half-second), and dragging.</p>
<h2>Navigation bar</h2>
<p>The {Navigation_bar} on the left side of the screen contains buttons that
  are always accessible:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The third button is the <i>Connection</i> button. Once you've
    connected the Chroma (via its USB device port) and turned it on, tap this
    to pop up a list of ports, and select one of the Chroma's four
    virtual jacks. If you're not connected, but still want to explore the
    Toolkit, select "Demonstrator".</li>
  <li>The four buttons in the middle switch the main part of the window among
    four screens. This is the <em>Help</em> screen. The <em>Programs</em>
    screen is where you select programs. The <em>Tools</em> screen allows old
    Chroma programs to be imported, and lets you tweak certain global
    parameters, such as the polarity of the levers. The <em>Editor</em> screen
    is where you edit the current program.</li>
  <li>The bottom buttons let you undo and redo any changes you make to the
    current program, or to stored programs. With these, you can safely try
    things out without worrying that you'll screw something up by
    touching the wrong control.</li>
  </ul>
<h2>Context sensitive help</h2>
<p>The {question.png height=16} buttons switch to the
  <em>Help</em> screen on a page appropriate to the context. Use them
  extensively to learn about the system; you can always get back to where you
  were by tapping the appropriate screen button.</p>
<h2>Programs screen</h2>
<p>To select sounds, tap <em>PROGRAMS</em>, and tap the various program buttons
  to try out various sounds. There are nine banks of 50 sounds (some empty),
  and you can switch to different banks by tapping the nine numbered buttons at
  the top.</p>
<h2>Popups</h2>
<p>The <em>Editor</em> screen has a lot of popups, which provide more detailed
  imformation and control than is available on the main screen. A popup is a
  box that appears in the middle of the screen, and dims the surrounding area
  to indicate it is temporarily inaccessible. A popup is dismissed by tapping
  in that dimmed area, or on its title.</p>
<h2>Editing programs</h2>
<p>Feel free to tinker with sounds. You can always tap <em>Undo</em> if you
  want to get back to where you were. The wide controls with colored bars in
  them are sliders you can drag. Most of the buttons pop up clusters of
  secondary parameters.</p>
<p>The wide buttons with "=" indicate that the parameters they
  represent are ganged in parallel with the parameters to their left. Clicking
  this button ungangs them.</p>
