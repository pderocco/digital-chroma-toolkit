<p><em>global parameter:</em> A numeric value that can be adjusted by the user,
which controls some aspect of the overall operation of the Digital Chroma, and
is not part of a {_program}. Examples are MIDI channel selection, and the
{_lever} polarities. From the Digital Chroma's panel, they can be
selected by pressing {_SET_SPLIT} and a number in the top row while in
{_program_select_mode}, and then varied with the {_parameter_control}. In the
Toolkit, they can be adjusted directly in the {Tools_screen}.</p>
