<h1>MIDI Program Get Metadata</h1>
<p>NRPN 81,0 on the Editor input channel reads back the {_timestamp}, link
  {_parameter parameters}, and flags from the current {_program} in the Main
  {_instrument} as a {MIDI_Program_Set_Metadata} NRPN 17,0. The Bank MSB and
  Data MSB values are ignored, but the latter must still be sent to trigger the
  operation.</p>
