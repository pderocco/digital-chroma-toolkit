<h1>WAVESHAPER shape cluster</h1>
<p>{waveshaper-shape-cluster.png width=373}</p>
<p>This contains the {Waveshaper_shape <i>shape</i>} {_parameter}, which
  selects the kind of wave shape, and the {Waveshaper_width <i>width</i>}
  {_slider} which alters the harmonic structure. For the pulse shape, this
  represents the width of the pulse in percent. For the saws shape, this
  represents the phase difference between two sawtooth waves, also in percent.
  For the various FM shapes, it represents the phase modulation depth in
  cycles. For the noise and impulse shapes, the width has no effect, nor do
  either of the {Waveshaper_mod_cluster modulation clusters}.</p>
