<h1>Levers</h1>
<p>If you're not used to {_lever levers} for modulation and pitch bend,
  you should know that the left lever (Lever 1) is normally assigned to
  modulation, and the right lever (Lever 2) is assigned to pitch bend. The
  fingers naturally align so that the thumb and forefinger are on either side
  of lever 2, while the middle finger is behind lever 1. This allows lever 2 to
  be both pushed and pulled, which is important for bending, while lever 1 is
  most easily pulled, which is all you really need for most modulation. With
  practice, you can learn to work the two levers independently, with only
  minimal finger movement, and no wrist or arm motion.</p>
<p>As shipped, pulling on lever 2 raises the pitch. This is nice if you
  usually bend upward, because it is easier to pull with your forefinger than
  push with your thumb. But if you prefer pushing to raise the pitch you can
  quickly swap the lever polarity by changing a {_global_parameter}. Make sure
  PROG SELECT is on, then press SET SPLIT, 12. The data readout will show the
  Lever 2 Polarity parameter, and the value "positive pull". Move
  the {_parameter_control} to change this to "positive push".
  Although it is less important, SET SPLIT, 11 allows Lever 1 to be inverted as
  well.</p>
