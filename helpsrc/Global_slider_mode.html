<h1>GLOBAL slider mode</h1>
<p>This controls how the Digital Chroma's sliders acquire control of a
  parameter, when assigned to a new parameter, or when the parameter value was
  changed by some other means. The choices are:</p>

<table class="vt">
  <tr>
    <td width="5%">
    <td width="10%">jump</td>
    <td>Sets the parameter to the value corresponding to the slider position as
      soon as it moves. Until then, a small triangle next to the value shows
      which direction the current value is, relative to the slider
      position.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/>
    <td>capture</td>
    <td>The slider must be moved through the position that corresponds to the
      current parameter value, before it takes control of the parameter. Until
      then, the triangle shows which direction the slider must be moved to
      capture the parameter.</td></tr>
  <tr><td/>
    <td>smooth</td>
    <td>The parameter changes whenever the slider is moved, along a slope that
      reaches the minimum or maximum value at the end of the slider travel.
      However, the slope is limited to 4x the normal slope, so the minimum or
      maximum value can be unreachable if the slider is already too close to
      that end. In this zone, the triangle shows which direction the slider
      must be moved to escape this zone.</td>
