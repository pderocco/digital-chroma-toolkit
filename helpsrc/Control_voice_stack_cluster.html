<h1>CONTROL voice stack cluster</h1>
<p>{control-voice-stack-cluster.png width=373}</p>
<p>This {_cluster} allows multiple {_voice voices} to be played for each note.
  The <i>{Control_voice_count}</i> parameter specifies the number
  of voices, up to four. All voices have the same sound, but the following
  {_parameter parameters} introduce differences; they have no effect if the
  Voice count is one.</p>
<p>The <i>{Control_tune_spread}</i> parameter causes the voices to
  be detuned. This is a half-scale detuning, in which the beat frequency
  doubles for each two-octave increase in pitch. The range is zero to 50\c,
  with a default value of 1\c so that the instrument doesn't sound
  completely dry. However, there are two special values at the high end of
  range, which connect this parameter to either {_pedal}. You can quickly set
  either of these values with the {_button buttons} below the {_slider}.</p>
<p>The <i>{Control_pan_spread}</i> parameter causes the voices to be
  spread out across the pan range. At zero, it does nothing, and all voices are
  controlled by the same Pan parameters so have the same position. At 45\d
  (the default), the pan range is cut in half, so that when two voices are
  assigned to the same note, the first can be panned from left to center
  (centered around \-45\d) and the second can be panned from center to
  right (centered around +45\d). 90\d forces one voice all the way to the
  left and the other all the way to the right, no matter what the Pan
  parameters say.</p>
