<h1>MIDI control representation</h1>
<p>The {_lever}, {_pedal}, and {_ribbon} controls can be configured by
  {_global_parameter global parameters} as either lo-res (low resolution) or
  hi-res. For instance, CC1 specifies the MSB (the most significant byte
  containing the top seven bits) of the modulation control, which maps to the
  positive side of Lever 1. If configured as hi-res, CC33 specifies the LSB
  (the least significant byte containing the bottom seven bits).</p>
<p>Internally, controls are represented as floating point values with a range
  of 0 to 1, or \-1 to +1 for bipolar controls. (Floating point values
  have fractional parts, unlike the integers that MIDI deals with.) The fact
  that n-bit binary numbers don't go quite all the way to 2<sup>n</sup>
  is dealt with by simply incrementing the highest value. Thus, the Digital
  Chroma treats lo-res performance control values as being in units of
  <sup>1</sup>/<sub>128</sub>, but treats the maximum value of 127 as meaning
  1, not <sup>127</sup>/<sub>128</sub>. This means that a mid-scale value of 64
  translates into exactly <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>. Similarly, the Digital
  Chroma treats 14-bit values as being in units of
  <sup>1</sup>/<sub>16384</sub>, but treats the maximum value of 16383 as
  meaning 1, not <sup>16383</sup>/<sub>16384</sub>.
<p>On input, the Digital Chroma defers processing of the MSB of any control
  that supports high resolution until the next message is received on the same
  channel, or until three milliseconds have elapsed. If the corresponding LSB
  isn't received within that time, the MSB is processed as a lo-res
  control. This avoids the tiny glitches that can result when the MSB changes
  on a very slow ramp.</p>
<p>An LSB that isn't preceded by its MSB, or whose MSB has already been
  processed by the 3ms timeout, is processed immediately, using the current
  MSB value. The Digital Chroma never transmits an LSB by itself.</p>
<p>NRPN or RPN data is treated differently. If a Data MSB is expected, a Data
  MSB must be received to trigger the processing. If a Data MSB and a Data LSB
  are both expected, they must both be received, MSB first, to trigger the
  processing.</p>
<p>MSB/LSB controls that are prefixes to other controls may be sent into the
  Digital Chroma in either order. The Digital Chroma always transmits MSB
  first.</p>
<p>The Digital Chroma only generates the low numbered Control Changes
  containing the MSB (the seven most significant bits) of the value, unless
  the controls are configured to be hi-res. Three global parameters allow this
  to be done for the levers, the pedals, and the optional ribbon controller.
  Other controls are always lo-res.</p>
