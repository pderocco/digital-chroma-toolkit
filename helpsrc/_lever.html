<p><em>lever:</em> One of the two controllers to the left of the keyboard on
  the Digital Chroma. The {_control_signal control signals} generated by them
  can be used to modulate anything, but typically the left lever is used to
  control {_sweep} amplitude, and indirectly vibrato, while the right is used
  to modulate {_oscillator} pitch, for pitch bend. This assignment works well
  because the thumb and forefinger can bend the pitch either way, while the
  middle finger can pull for vibrato.<p>
<p>Note that each side of a lever's range can be used as a separate
  modulation source, with names starting with "\-lever" or
  "+lever".</p>
<p>The physical polarities of the levers (which direction is considered
  positive) can be set by {_global_parameter global parameters} according to
  the player's preference.</p>
