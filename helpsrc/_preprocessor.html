<p><em>preprocessor:</em> The software module in the Digital Chroma that splits
the notes from the keyboard into main and {_link_program link} streams, does main
and link octave transpositions, performs keyboard algorithms like
{_arpeggiation}, and handles the {_footswitch} and {_ribbon} mode
{_parameter parameters}.</p>
<p>When recording a sequence in an external DAW via the {_USB_device_port}
MIDI, it is the output of the preprocessor that is recorded. This means that
the USB device port MIDI input doesn't perform those preprocessor
functions, or support those parameters, since those functions were already
performed during the recording.</p>
