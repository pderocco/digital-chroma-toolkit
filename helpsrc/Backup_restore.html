<h1>Backup \& Restore</h1>
<p>{backup-restore.png width=346}</p>
<p>This tool lets you back up a single bank, or all banks, from the Digital
  Chroma to a folder on the computer running the Toolkit, and to restore single
  banks or all banks back to the Digital Chroma.</p>
<h2>Backup</h2>
<p>Tap the bank button corresponding to the bank you wish to back up, or tap
  "all" for all of them. Then tap the <i>folder</i> button,
  navigate to the folder you wish to store the programs in, creating it if it
  doesn't already exist. Finally, tap the "backup" button. A
  progress bar will momentarily appear, and any problem will cause a message to
  appear in place of the progress bar. You can dismiss this message by tapping
  it.</p>
<p>A single bank is backed up as up to fifty files named "01.chr"
  to "50.chr". A non-existent program is represented by the absence
  of the corresponding file. All banks are backed up as nine sub-folders named
  "1" through "9", each containing up to fifty program
  files.</p>
<p>If you back up to an existing folder that already has Digital Chroma
  programs in it, those programs will be overwritten, or deleted in the case of
  non-existent programs. Since these old programs are contained in the computer
  and not the Digital Chroma, they are not protected by the Undo mechanism, so
  make sure you don't back up to the wrong place.</p>
<h2>Restore</h2>
<p>Tap the bank button corresponding to the bank you wish to restore, or tap
  "all" for all of them. Then tap the <i>folder</i> button,
  navigate to the folder that contains the programs. Finally, tap the
  "restore" button. A progress bar will momentarily appear, and any
  problem will cause a message to appear in place of the progress bar. You can
  dismiss this message by tapping it.</p>
<p>If you're restoring a single bank, you must choose the folder
  containing the up to fifty ".chr" files. If you're
  restoring all banks, you must choose the folder containing the nine numbered
  sub-folders. When you restore a single bank, you are free to restore it into
  any bank, not necessarily the one you originally backed up.</p>
<p>When you restore, all programs in the affected bank or banks within the
  Digital Chroma are overwritten, or deleted in the case of missing programs.
  If you select an erroneous folder that has no programs in it, the Toolkit
  will delete all programs in the affected bank or banks. However, the old
  programs are protected by the Undo mechanism, so you can undo the restore
  operation if you accidentally restore from the wrong folder, or if you
  restore into the wrong bank.</p>
<h2>Flash drive backup</h2>
<p>The Digital Chroma has panel functions (the old cassette interface) that
  allow banks to be backed up and restored to an external flash drive. These
  are always stored in the same form as a Toolkit backup of all banks, with
  subfolders "1" to "9". Those subfolders are contained
  within a root folder usually called "CHROMA1", although the final
  digit matches the name used by the instrument over USB and Ethernet, as set
  by the {Chroma_number} calibration function. Since the format is the same, it
  is possible to back up via the control panel and then restore via the
  Toolkit, or vice versa.</p>
